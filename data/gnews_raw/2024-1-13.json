        "title": "Blackrock CEO Larry Fink Sees A Case For Spot Ethereum ETF, But Will It Get Approval? - Investopedia",
        "content": "Key Takeaways Blackrock CEO Larry Fink said he \"sees value\" in an Ethereum ETF in a recent interview.\n\nBlackrock, Fidelity, VanEck, and others have already filed for spot Ethereum ETFs, with some of the final deadlines for decisions from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) scheduled for May.\n\nA spot Ethereum ETF approval may be more problematic than was the case with bitcoin, as there is the potential for Ethereum's underlying crypto asset to be classified as a security.\n\nBlackrock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink may have generated momentum for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). However, the approval for such a product will likely face a big regulatory hurdle.\n\n\"I see value in having an Ethereum ETF. As I said, these are just stepping stones towards tokenization,\" Fink said in an interview with CNBC Friday morning, just a day after the first spot bitcoin ETFs began trading in the U.S.\n\n\n\nWhy Fink's Comments Matter To An ETH ETF?\n\nBlackrock originally changed how people thought about whether a spot bitcoin ETF would even be possible when the financial titan filed for their own offering in June 2023. They now have their own spot Ethereum ETF proposal as well. Many of the other same financial institutions, such as Ark, and Fidelity, that saw their spot bitcoin ETF products launch on Thursday, have also filed for spot Ether ETFs with the SEC.\n\n\n\nVanEck is first in line for the potential approval of their spot Ethereum ETF product, with a final deadline for a decision from the SEC set for May 23rd.\n\n\n\nETH ETF May Face Regulatory Hurdles\n\nWhile ether is often lumped in with bitcoin (BTCUSD) as the two major blue chip crypto projects, there are concerns that a spot ether ETF approval could be a more complex proposal. Much of the uncertainty around such a financial product has to do with the potential classification of ether (ETHUSD), which is the underlying crypto asset of the Ethereum system, as a security.\n\nWhen asked whether the approval of a spot bitcoin ETF could open the door for other crypto asset ETF approvals, such as a spot Ethereum ETF, SEC Chair Gary Gensler stated, \"I look at what we did this week as its cabined to one non-security, commodity called bitcoin.\"\n\nThat said, Brown Rudnick Partner Preston Byrne says there may not be many regulatory roadblocks to a spot Ethereum ETF approval. \"So far, the only American regulator to assert that Ethereum is a security in an enforcement action is the NYAG's office,\" Byrne told Investopedia. \"Ethereum's possible status as an unregistered security is a minority view, especially given the fact that the Ethereum Foundation's 2014 sale of Ether is now well past the statute of limitations. I would expect diligent lawyering to address the point in required statutory investor disclosures, but would not expect too much more regulatory interference beyond that.\"\n\nBloomberg ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas has pegged the odds of a spot Ethereum ETF approval by May at 70%.\n\nNotably, futures-based Ether ETF products are already available for trade in the U.S. market. However, these offerings have not gained much traction and originally launched without much interest from traders."

        "title": "SEC unlikely to approve spot Ethereum ETFs 'any time soon': TD Cowen - The Block",
        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is not expected to approve spot Ethereum ETH +1.34% exchange-traded funds in the near future, according to the investment bank TD Cowen. The initial deadline for approving such funds is in May.\n\n\"Our expectation is that the agency will not be approving ETPs for other crypto tokens any time soon as we believe the SEC will want to gain experience from Bitcoin BTC +2.44% ETPs before it approves an Ethereum or other crypto token ETP,\" wrote TD Cowen Washington Research Group, led by Jaret Seiberg, in a note earlier this week. \"The wait might not be as long as 26 months, but it likely would be after the election.\"\n\nThe SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs earlier this week after over a decade of rejections, and 26 months after greenlighting bitcoin futures ETFs in October 2021. The 2024 U.S. presidential elections are scheduled to be held in November.\n\nAfter the spot bitcoin ETF approvals, traders are now betting that spot Ethereum ETFs could be next in line to receive the green light as the price of ether has surged over the past week. While some analysts are more optimistic that spot ETH ETFs will get approved, others, like those at JPMorgan, aren't betting big. \"In our opinion, for the SEC to approve spot Ethereum ETFs in May, it would need to classify Ethereum as a commodity (similar to bitcoin) rather than a security,\" JPMorgan's Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou told The Block this week. \"This is far from given, and I wouldn't put more than a 50% chance to the SEC classifying Ethereum as a commodity before May.\"\n\nSeveral big firms, including BlackRock and Fidelity, have recently filed for spot ETH ETFs.\n\n'Gensler is in no hurry to act'\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nWhile approving spot bitcoin ETFs, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said that a federal court gave the agency little choice but to approve those funds as the SEC had lost in a legal case brought against it by Grayscale Investments. \"While we approved the listing and trading of certain spot bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse bitcoin,\" Gensler said at the time, adding that he maintains his view that \"the vast majority of crypto assets are investment contracts and thus subject to the federal securities laws.\"\n\nTD Cowen said it views the spot bitcoin ETF approval as consistent with its thesis that Gensler is \"taking a go-slow approach modeled over how the agency established rules for the ABS [asset-backed securities] market.\" The approval also \"does not expedite the schedule for crypto market structure legislation,\" the bank said.\n\n\"This does not change our expectations for crypto market structure. We believe it will require Congress to enact legislation to establish the framework for how tokens will be regulated, what type of disclosures will be required and which agency will be in charge of investor protections,\" TD Cowen said. \"Our view remains that Gensler sees enforcement actions and litigation as aiding that process by narrowing the issues that Congress must resolve.\"\n\nGensler's term ends in June 2026, and he could maintain a Democratic majority at the SEC until then, according to TD Cowen. \"It is yet another reason we believe Gensler is in no hurry to act,\" the bank said, adding that he has time to bring more cases and await more court rulings rather than trying to rush legislative action.\n\n\"This also lets the U.S. learn from other jurisdictions before enacting a regulatory regime that will be tough to change once adopted,\" the bank concluded."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Key Levels to Focus If $ETH Enters New Correction - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: The second largest cryptocurrency Ethereum(ETH) has been notably bullish this week likely attributed to the recent launch of the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S market. Surprisingly, the ETH price surpassed the Bitcoin performance amid the ETF approval recording a 17.7% weekly growth. Amid this upswing, the coin buyers breached above the $2430 swing high, indicating the potential for a higher recovery.\n\nIs Ethereum Price Heading to $3000?\n\nThe ETH price will continue to walk an aggressive rally until the ascending support trendline is intact.\n\nThe rising prices may face supply pressure at $2700, followed by $3000\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $16.8 Billion, indicating a 14% loss.\n\nOver the past three months, the Ethereum price has exhibited a consistent upward trajectory, evidenced by an ascending trendline. Starting from a low of $1522, the price of the coin has experienced a remarkable surge of 77%, reaching a new high of $2717.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe periodic pullbacks within this rally suggest active buyer accumulation at lower price points, a crucial characteristic of a prolonged rally. Throughout December, the ETH price movement was predominantly lateral, as the market anticipated the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nAs the US SEC approved BTC ETF trading on Wednesday, the ETH price jumped 10.21% to breach the overhead resistance of $2140 indicating the asset is poised for higher growth.\n\nMoreover, Larry Fink, the Chief Executive Officer of BlackRock, expressed support for the idea of introducing an Ethereum-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). This statement came shortly after the launch of the highly anticipated Bitcoin ETF. In a recent discussion on CNBC, Fink said, \u201cI see value in having an Ethereum ETF,\u201d. Later he also added, \u201cThese are just stepping stones towards tokenization and I really do believe this is where we\u2019re going to be going\u201d.\n\nFollowing the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF, the prospects for a Spot Ethereum ETF have significantly increased, potentially setting the stage for substantial growth in Ethereum\u2019s value.\n\nKey Support To Watch in Market Correction\n\nBy the press time, Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,565, experiencing a slight retracement to retest the previously surpassed resistance level of $2,400. Should the price sustainably remain above this newly established support, there\u2019s potential for the ongoing recovery to extend towards targets of $2,700, followed by $3,000, and $3,281.\n\nConversely, in the event of a fresh correction in the ETH price, investors should pay close attention to the ascending trendline. This could present an opportunity for a strategic pullback, offering a potential entry point for those looking to capitalize on such market movements\n\nBollinger Band: An uptick in the upper boundary of the Bollinger Band indicator shows the buyers dominating the asset.\n\nAverage Directional Index: The daily ADX value of 19% indicates the last correction has managed to recover the exhausted bullish momentum.\n\nRelated Articles:"

        "title": "Liquid staking protocols: new era for Ethereum validators - crypto.news",
        "content": "Discover how Ethereum\u2019s shift to PoS and liquid staking protocols transform blockchain technology and address the 32 ETH staking challenge.\n\nEthereum staking has revolutionized the way we use and interact with blockchain technology. With its security now relying on capital rather than computing power, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) offers numerous benefits, including a reported 99% reduction in the network\u2019s carbon footprint.\n\nHowever, it still presents several drawbacks, chief among them being the 32 ETH economic requirement for participants to run a dedicated node on the network.\n\nYou might also like: What is proof-of-stake (PoS)?\n\nLiquid staking protocols: what to look out for\n\nAs of January, 32 ETH is about $84,724. Not many would-be validators can easily afford that amount, especially in regions with lower incomes.\n\nAdditionally, staking funds become locked and lack liquidity, pushing stakers to join staking pools instead. These pools often prove more profitable than individual validators due to the advantages of smoothing effects, safety mechanisms, and insurance they offer.\n\nThe situation has led to a concentration of power on the Ethereum network, with a small number of stakers controlling a significant share of the blockchain. Since these entities hold most of Ethereum\u2019s validator keys, it gives them full control over crucial aspects like block production, transaction censorship, and MEV (maximal extractable value) choices.\n\nBreakdown of top depositors on Ethereum | Source: Etherscan\n\nAnd as these pools grow larger, they gain more strength, eroding the core decentralization principles of Ethereum. As a result, there have been calls for more decentralized and pocket-friendly solutions to address this concern.\n\nThis is where community-driven liquid staking protocols come in. These platforms offer a new way to stake ETH and enjoy the benefits of staking while maintaining liquidity and flexibility. To shed light on this groundbreaking trend, we sat down with the teams behind three emerging liquid staking protocols: ether.fi, Diva, and Tenderize.\n\nYou might also like: Vitalik Buterin unveils major overhaul of Ethereum staking\n\nether.fi: unlocking liquid staking\n\nEther.fi team has pioneered a non-custodial protocol that enables users to stake their ETH holdings while keeping their private keys securely in their possession.\n\nether.fi business model | Source: ether.fi\n\nAmong the people associated with this project is Arthur Hayes, an investor who actively contributes to ether.fi through his family office, Maelstrom.\n\nYou might also like: Arthur Hayes dumps Solana for Ether, cites divine inspiration\n\nWhen we asked the ether.fi team about their target audience, they responded,\n\n\u201cWe cater to individuals who have a keen interest in staking Ethereum.\u201d\n\nHowever, they also highlighted the regulatory uncertainties surrounding ETH staking in the United States. Consequently, ether.fi has temporarily geofenced U.S. users until the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provides more precise guidance.\n\nYou might also like: Staking rewards are now taxable, says IRS\n\nThe ether.fi team prioritized security for their protocol, employing auditors like Nethermind, Omniscia, Zellic, and Solidified to enhance safety measures.\n\nEther.fi offers loyalty points and membership programs, providing rewards for users. The platform adopts a non-custodial approach, allowing users to maintain control over their keys, aligning with the principle of \u201cNot your keys, not your coins.\u201d\n\nTo tackle liquidity and volatility issues in staked tokens, ether.fi has made provisions for users to withdraw or trade their assets through the eETH liquidity pool.\n\nAs of Jan. 12, ether.fi was one of the major liquid staking protocols per the amount of ETH staked in the last six months.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ether_fi/status/1745565800830763314\n\nDiva: another approach to liquid staking\n\nDiva, a liquid staking protocol that will be launched in 2024. Diva\u2019s distributed validator technology (DVT) allows the entire network to perform validation, reducing the risks associated with centralization. Per developers, Diva\u2019s security model, based on DVT, offers improved uptime and a diverse range of operators without requiring permission.\n\nDiva liquid staking model | Source: Diva on Medium\n\nIt provides an alternative to solo staking, which demands 32 ETH per validator and requires considerable technical expertise. Diva\u2019s operator union model makes staking more accessible by allowing users to lock as little as 1 ETH while providing better rewards and flexibility, according to the protocol\u2019s developers.\n\nThe platform engages its community through Discord channels, encouraging users to contribute to early testing and provide feedback. According to the team, the community plays a significant role in governance decisions, ensuring the protocol evolves in response to the needs and concerns of its users.\n\nThe Ethereum Shanghai upgrade has played a crucial role in accelerating the growth of liquid staking for ETH. This upgrade completed the circle for Diva, particularly by making liquid staking tokens (LSTs) fully functional. This functionality allows LSTs to trade closely to their fair value, significantly reducing the cost of providing liquidity in defi.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum Shanghai upgrade for geeks: unpacking the tech side\n\nWith deep liquidity pools now more accessible, protocols like Diva may gain a competitive advantage over established players like Lido Finance.\n\nTo ensure the stability and liquidity of the stETH derivative token, Diva employs divETH tokens, which closely track ETH at a 1:1 ratio. This approach, combined with DVT-based security, is how Diva mitigates significant price deviations from ETH.\n\nThe protocol has also adopted a special approach to navigate legal challenges and ensure regulatory compliance globally. Instead of operating as a traditional company or platform, Diva positions itself as a pure software extension of Ethereum. Its immutable code, similar to contracts such as Wrapped ETH or Liquity, ensures that no central entity offers services or charges fees. Diva aims to establish regulatory equivalences by staking on Ethereum itself, simplifying compliance efforts.\n\nAt the time of writing, Diva has not yet launched. However, by offering an Operator Testnet Alpha and proposing a Pre-Launch Vault, Diva aims to encourage early commitments of total value locked (TVL) in ETH or stETH.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/divastaking/status/1737879212625719690\n\nTenderize: empowering validators\n\nTenderize is a liquid staking solution that allows any validator on the network to participate, potentially unlocking as much as $30 billion worth of crypto previously neglected in liquid staking.\n\nAccording to the Tenderize team, the platform has attempted to tackle issues of neglected assets by providing each validator with highly-liquid staked tokens, promoting decentralization in the ecosystem.\n\nTendirize ecosystem | Source: Tenderize website\n\nThe platform has a new upgrade dubbed Tenderize v2, and what sets it apart, in the words of its creators, is its self-custodial nature, which eliminates the need for intermediaries. It means users can swiftly exit staking through a native decentralized exchange (DEX), with the shared liquidity approach ensuring greater flexibility and liquidity access without centralizing stake on whitelisted nodes.\n\nMuch like Diva, the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade played a vital role in accelerating the growth of liquid staking for Tenderize, with the platform reportedly experiencing its fair share of positive impact.\n\nPrior to the upgrade, TenderSwap, a crucial component of the Tenderize protocol, faced limitations in facilitating unstaking. However, with the upgrade, users could unstake ETH, which paved the way for the launch of tETH through Tenderize v2.\n\nThe protocol emphasizes community involvement in its development, with Tenderize offering grants to validators and liquidity providers for their input and testing. The platform also involves token holders in governance decisions, such as fee and reward determination.\n\nIn liquid staking, addressing stability and liquidity concerns is crucial. Tenderize offers two methods for converting tTokens back to their original form.\n\nOne method is through TenderSwap v2, where users can exchange their tTokens (like tMATIC, tLPT, or tGRT) for the corresponding asset (MATIC, LPT, or GRT) at a 1:1 ratio, subject to a service fee. The alternative method requires waiting for the unstaking period to end, which varies by blockchain. Tenderize aims to maintain a 1:1 swap ratio on TenderSwap to manage price deviation risks and support user stability and liquidity.\n\nThe mainnet launch is scheduled at Jan. 29, according to Tenderize X account.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/tenderize_me/status/1745799023569879411\n\nLiquid staking protocols: the future of staking?\n\nEthereum staking represents a notable development in the cryptocurrency space, with various projects contributing to this trend. These projects enable users to stake amounts less than 32 ETH, supporting Ethereum\u2019s transition to proof-of-stake.\n\nAdditionally, these projects offer methods for users to liquidate their staked assets without undergoing a full withdrawal process, enhancing the flexibility of cryptocurrency staking.\n\nProjects supporting ETH staking below the 32 ETH threshold provide an opportunity for users to participate in staking with smaller investments.\n\nRead more: Ethereum applications take place as top gainers ahead of ETF announcement\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Staying informed and educated about the latest developments in blockchain technology has become more important than ever, and that is precisely where The Crypto Basic plays a crucial role.\n\nDedicated to providing insightful and up-to-date information on all things crypto, we stand as a beacon for both novices and experts navigating the multifaceted panorama of cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn this comprehensive article, we delve deep into one of the most groundbreaking aspects of blockchain technology: Ethereum\u2019s smart contract revolution; our aim is to demystify the concept of smart contracts, explain their significance in the Ethereum ecosystem, and explore how they are reshaping the world of digital transactions and contracts.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nJoin us on this informative journey with The Crypto Basic, your trusted source for crypto news, as we unravel the intricacies of Ethereum and its pioneering smart contract technology.\n\nWhat is a Smart Contract?\n\nA smart contract is a revolutionary concept in the blockchain and cryptocurrency world; it is essentially a computer program stored on a blockchain that automatically executes, controls, or documents legally relevant events and actions according to the terms of a contract or an agreement.\n\nThe concept of smart contracts was proposed by Nick Szabo in 1994, long before Bitcoin was created; his idea was to use a decentralized ledger to store contracts, which would then self-execute and self-maintain, ensuring that all parties involved adhere to the contract terms.\n\nHow is Ethereum Related to Smart Contracts?\n\nEthereum, launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin and his team, was the first blockchain platform designed specifically for creating and executing smart contracts.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIt\u2019s not just a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin \u2013 Ethereum is a platform for decentralized applications (dApps) where smart contracts are used as the building blocks; these contracts are written in Ethereum\u2019s native programming language, Solidity, and are compiled into bytecode, which the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can read and execute.\n\nThis technology has enabled Ethereum to become a leader in decentralized finance (DeFi) and other blockchain-based applications.\n\nBenefits of Ethereum Smart Contracts\n\nEthereum smart contracts offer several key benefits:\n\n1. Automated Enforcement\n\nThey automatically execute the terms of the contract when predefined conditions are met.\n\n2. Increased Security\n\nEthereum smart contracts are secure and immutable, reducing the risk of fraud and tampering.\n\n3. Cost-Efficient\n\nBy eliminating intermediaries, these contracts reduce transaction costs.\n\n4. Transparency\n\nAll transactions are visible on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and trust among parties.\n\n5. Speed\n\nSmart contracts automate processes and significantly reduce transaction times.\n\nHow Ethereum Works and Its Security Features\n\nThe core of Ethereum\u2019s functionality lies in its ability to execute smart contracts securely \u2013 this is achieved through the EVM, which serves as the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum.\n\nThe EVM is isolated from the main network, providing a sandboxed environment where smart contracts can run without affecting other operations on the blockchain.\n\nSecurity is a paramount concern in Ethereum\u2019s design: the decentralized nature of the blockchain ensures that the contracts are resistant to hacking, and the use of cryptographic techniques provides additional layers of security; however, it\u2019s crucial to note that the code quality of a smart contract determines its security, making thorough testing and auditing essential.\n\nWhat are the Advantages of Using Ethereum over Normal Contracts?\n\nEthereum smart contracts offer several advantages over traditional contracts:\n\n1. Trustless Environment\n\nThey operate in a trustless environment, meaning parties do not need to trust each other for the contract to be executed.\n\n2. Global Accessibility\n\nEthereum\u2019s decentralized nature allows smart contracts to be accessed and executed from anywhere in the world.\n\n3. Reduced Fraud Risk\n\nThe immutability of smart contracts minimizes the risk of fraud and manipulation.\n\n4. Streamlined Processes\n\nThey streamline business processes by automating tasks that are traditionally done manually.\n\nEthereum Price and Market Trends\n\nThe Ethereum price and its prediction are crucial for investors and users alike: as Ethereum continues to develop, especially with the upcoming transition to Ethereum 2.0, its value is expected to reflect the growing utility of its network.\n\nThe platform\u2019s ability to support a wide range of applications, including DeFi, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and various dApps, contributes to its standing in the crypto market; however, like all cryptocurrencies, Ethereum\u2019s price is subject to market dynamics and can be volatile.\n\nFuture of Ethereum and Smart Contracts\n\nThe future of Ethereum and its smart contracts looks promising \u2013 with advancements like Ethereum 2.0, which aims to increase scalability, security, and sustainability, the platform is poised for further growth.\n\nThe ongoing development in areas such as DeFi and NFTs will likely continue to drive innovation and adoption of Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nAdditionally, the increasing interest from enterprises in blockchain technology suggests a bright future for Ethereum in various sectors beyond finance.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nEthereum\u2019s contribution to the blockchain space, particularly through its smart contract technology, is undeniably transformative.\n\nAs a pioneer and leader in this field, Ethereum has set the standard for decentralized applications and has opened the door to a range of possibilities across various sectors \u2013 from creating new financial instruments in DeFi to facilitating unique digital ownership through NFTs, Ethereum\u2019s impact is widespread.\n\nAs the platform continues to develop, particularly with the anticipated Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, its role in shaping the future of blockchain technology and digital transactions is expected to grow even more significant.\n\nFor anyone interested in crypto news concerning the intersection of technology, finance, and innovation, Ethereum\u2019s journey is one to watch closely, as always, via The Crypto Basic."

This negative price movement comes after an initial price boost by the token which it gained by over 19% following news of the Bitcoin spot ETF approval in the US on Wednesday.\n\nInterestingly, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez has offered more insight into ETH\u2019s developing downtrend, highlighting the next possible support zones for crypto\u2019s largest altcoin.\n\nEthereum May Be Headed For $2,450 \u2013 Analyst\n\nIn an X post on January 11, Martinez shared that the TD Sequential indicator presented a sell signal on the Ethereum 4-hour chart, which could possibly result in the altcoin\u2019s price falling to a support level of $2,530.\n\nFor context, the Tom Demark Sequential indicator is a popular TA tool used to identify trend exhaustion and predict possible trend reversals.\n\nAccording to Martinez, this analysis tool showed that ETH was due for a price correction following a price surge in which the asset traded above $2,700 in reaction to the US Securities and Exchange greenlighting the launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs on US securities markets.\n\nIf #Ethereum can\u2019t hold above $2,530, the next stop will be $2,450! https://t.co/wtjcdRTWnv \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) January 12, 2024\n\nInterestingly, in a second post on January 12, the renowned crypto analyst doubled down on this prediction stating that if the ETH bulls failed to keep the coin\u2019s value above $2,530, there was a chance the token could trade as low as $2,450.\n\nAccording to Martinez, ETH\u2019s current negative price movement appears to be a mere correction which is likely true as the general investor sentiment around the altcoin remains bullish.\n\nEarlier this week, NewsBTC reported that ETH investors are hyped with the expectation of an Ether spot ETF in the US following the SEC\u2019s clearance of 11 Bitcoin spot ETF applications on Wednesday. Considering ETH\u2019s rank as the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, as well as the rising number of Ether spot ETF applications, investors believe the altcoin may be in line for the SEC\u2019s favor.\n\nETH\u2019s Price Overview\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum was trading at $2,548 with a slight decline of 2.67% in the last day. However, the altcoin has shown an overall bullish performance in the last week, with a notable gain of 14.48%. Adding to this positive narrative, there is also an uptick in ETH\u2019s daily volume by 22.25% which is currently now valued at $26.8 billion.\n\nETH trading at $2,553 on the daily chart | Source: ETHUSDT chart on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Forbes, chart from Tradingview\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are currently following a pattern similar to previous years, during which their prices surged by 500% and 1,000%, respectively, according to the latest research report by Coinbase Research and Glassnode.\n\nThe observation draws parallels between the ongoing crypto market cycle and the period from 2018 to 2022, characterized by substantial price increases in both cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin Halving\u2019s Potential Impact on Crypto Markets\n\nAnalysts highlight various cyclicality metrics, such as net unrealized profit/loss and supply in profit, which mirror past trends. These metrics indicate that the present state of the crypto markets doesn\u2019t mirror the euphoric conditions seen during the peak of 2023. It suggests there might still be potential for the market to experience further surges.\n\nDespite acknowledging the potential positive impact of the forthcoming Bitcoin halving, Coinbase Research is cautious.\n\nThe paper noted a lack of robust supporting evidence and characterized the relationship between the halving and market performance as somewhat speculative.\n\nThe research points out that, with only three halving events historically, there isn\u2019t a fully established pattern, especially considering previous events were influenced by factors like global liquidity measures.\n\nThe upcoming Bitcoin halving, projected to occur in April 2024 based on current mining rates, will reduce the block reward from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC.\n\nAnalyzing Ethereum\u2019s Market and Upcoming Upgrade\n\nIn 2023, the Ethereum (ETH) price surged by over 90%, driven by several factors, such as the success of the Shapella upgrade and the increasing likelihood of approval for spot crypto ETFs. Market participants were encouraged by these developments, contributing to the increase in the ETH value.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts are focusing on the upcoming Ethereum upgrade named Cancun. It is expected to enhance scalability and security to make layer-2 transactions as cost-effective as possible.\n\nThe successful implementation of Cancun could potentially lead to a significant increase in the number of processed transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s analysis notes that Bitcoin and Ethereum have undergone two cycles, encompassing both bull and bear markets. The ongoing cycle, initiated in 2022, closely mirrors the patterns observed in the preceding ones."

Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nEthereum, often regarded as the backbone of the decentralised finance (DeFi) ecosystem and a primary driver of the crypto market, is currently experiencing a resurgence that has caught the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. After a rollercoaster ride, Ethereum has not just survived but thrived, with its price surging from $1,600 and smashing past the $2,000 barrier. With the next obstacle at $2,400, the question on everyone\u2019s minds is whether Ethereum is gearing up for a new breakout. Adding fuel to the fire of Ethereum\u2019s resurgence is the improving sentiment in the crypto market, largely driven by high expectations surrounding the potential approval of the Bitcoin Spot ETF. As a result, the price of ETH has been skyrocketing. As of the latest data, ETH\u2019s price action reveals the formation of a bullish flag pattern due to the consolidation between the $2,200 support and the $2,400 resistance. With Ethereum dropping hints of further breakouts, buyer enthusiasm is growing, suggesting a potential bullish trend for 2024.\n\nETH Price Prediction for January 2024\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has been engaged in a tantalising game of tug-of-war, struggling to establish a definitive trend over the past 30 days. However, the recent market-wide recovery aligns well with bullish ETH price predictions. All eyes are currently on the $2,400 barrier, which buyers are eagerly eyeing to breach. Despite experiencing a slight retreat from the New Year\u2019s rally, ETH has managed to avoid the sharp declines witnessed in other smaller-cap altcoins. The robust buying activity around the $2,200 support level is fueling this resilience. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $2,432, with a minor intraday pullback following a significant overnight surge. The consistent bouncing off the $2,200 mark keeps hopes alive for a breakout beyond $2,400. The current technical landscape suggests that Ethereum is on the verge of a bullish breakout. The formation of a bullish flag pattern in the daily chart, a classic trend continuation indicator, points to the potential for a surge beyond the $2,400 level. With a recent test of the $2,400 resistance and a growing likelihood of surpassing $2,500, Ethereum may well be on its way to $2,700. However, traders should remain cautious, as a reversal could send ETH tumbling back to the $2,200 support zone.\n\nETH Price Prediction 2024\n\nEthereum market price has shown remarkable recovery, forming an ascending triangle pattern in the weekly chart. After bouncing off the psychological barrier of $1,000 in November 2022, the uptrend has continued to gain momentum in the Ethereum weekly chart. Despite facing consistent rejection at the $2,100 barrier, buyers are making efforts for a bullish breakout, fueled by the recent Uptober rally of 2023. Having surged past the overhead resistance, the ETH price has broken through the $2,200 barrier. Moreover, this breakout rally signals a prolonged uptrend and avoids a death cross in the weekly chart. If buyers successfully push Ethereum\u2019s market value above $2,200, the continuation of the bull run could lead to exponential growth in 2024. With potential Spot ETF approvals and the potential impact of the Bitcoin Halving on altcoins, Ethereum\u2019s price could potentially reach $3,825.\n\nRetik Finance: Paving the Way for DeFi Excellence in 2024\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s resurgence and price predictions are garnering significant attention, there is another player in the crypto space that is creating a path for itself to outperform altcoins in 2024. Retik Finance (RETIK), a dynamic decentralised finance (DeFi) token built upon the Ethereum mainnet following the ERC20 standard, has been making waves.

        "content": "BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink is supporting the creation of spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nIn a new interview on CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box, Fink says that after spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs were just approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it would be worthwhile for the agency to also approve spot ETH ETFs.\n\nFink also believes that tokenization in the financial space could result in a crackdown on corruption, such as money laundering.\n\n\u201cI see value in having an Ethereum ETF. As I said, these are just stepping stones towards tokenization. And I really do believe this is where we\u2019re going to be going. We have the technology to tokenize today. Think about this, if you had a tokenized security and you have a tokenized identity, you Andrew [Sorkin], the moment you buy or sell an instrument, it\u2019s known, it\u2019s on a general ledger that is all created together. You want to talk about issues around money laundering and all that, this eliminates all corruption by having a tokenized system.\u201d\n\nFink adds that he believes Bitcoin is a safe store of value similar to how gold was historically during times of uncertainty.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a believer in [Bitcoin] because I do believe it is an alternative source for wealth holding. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s ever going to be a currency. I believe it\u2019s an asset class. I think we\u2019re going to create digital currencies. We\u2019re going to use the technology for it. We\u2019re going to use the blockchain\u2026\n\nI believe [Bitcoin] goes up if the world is more frightened, if people are fearful of geopolitical risk, if they\u2019re fearful of their own risk. It\u2019s no different than what gold represented over thousands of years. It is an asset class that protects you.

        "title": "Forget XRP: This Crypto Could Be Unstoppable in 2024 - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "At the end of December, Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) flipped XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) to become the fifth-most valuable cryptocurrency. This capped off an impressive run for Solana in 2023. At one point, Solana was up more than 1,000% for the year.\n\nAll this has me thinking it's finally time to forget about XRP. The former crypto market darling is still bogged down in litigation with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Until that regulatory matter is cleared up, XRP shows no signs of breaking through the $1 price level. Contrast that to Solana, which now seems to have a very bright future ahead of it. Let's take a closer look.\n\nSolana is on pace to topple Ethereum\n\nThe primary investment thesis for Solana is that it is the new Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH). Since 2020, crypto investors have been touting Solana as a potential \"Ethereum killer,\" and that scenario now seems to be finally playing out. While there are plenty of other Layer 1 blockchain challengers out there, Solana seems to be the one with the best chance of displacing Ethereum.\n\nSimply stated, Solana is a faster, cheaper, more efficient version of Ethereum. While Ethereum had to pull off a very complicated technical transformation (known as The Merge) to become an energy-efficient, proof-of-stake blockchain back in 2022, Solana launched right out of the box as a proof-of-stake blockchain. Whether it's transaction processing speed or overall transaction throughput, Solana seems to have the superior technology.\n\nGranted, the \"best technology\" does not always win. There are a lot of other factors to consider, including first-mover advantage and network effects. That's why Solana has taken nearly four years to finally catch up to Ethereum. But the investment narrative around Solana certainly seems to be shifting. A number of very smart investors -- including Cathie Wood of Ark Invest -- now seem to buy into the idea of Solana as a faster, more cost-efficient version of Ethereum.\n\nStory continues\n\nSolana has some big-time growth catalysts in place\n\nWhile Ethereum has been around longer than Solana, Solana has one thing Ethereum does not: a mobile crypto strategy. First announced back in the summer of 2022, this mobile crypto strategy has steadily been taking shape over the past 18 months.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nLast May, Solana finally launched the first-ever mobile crypto phone, the Saga. The goal of the crypto phone was to usher in a new mobile-first approach to crypto. Think about it -- today's smartphones are not crypto-native. They are designed for neither crypto users nor crypto wallets or for buying non-fungible tokens (NFTs) while waiting in line for a coffee from your favorite barista. So, Solana -- led by a talented team of former Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) engineers -- decided to change all that.\n\nThis mobile crypto strategy also includes a mobile payments component. In February 2022, Solana launched Solana Pay, a blockchain-based payment protocol for merchants who want to accept crypto at the point of sale. Again, this builds on a very intuitive idea: Some people want to pay with crypto, and most merchants want to avoid high credit card processing fees. As a proof-of-concept, Solana announced an integration with Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) at the end of August.\n\nYes, of course, these mobile crypto initiatives could absolutely fail. But they are the types of big-time growth catalysts that XRP simply does not have right now. As long as the legal drama with the SEC stretches on (which could be until the end of 2024), it's highly unlikely that XRP will be able to do much of anything in the U.S. market.\n\nAt the same time, the company behind the XRP token (Ripple Labs) is hemorrhaging cash to pay lawyers. According to Ripple executives, these legal costs could wind up being more than $200 million.\n\nBefore you dump all your XRP tokens\n\nWhile I'm highly confident that Solana could be an unstoppable crypto in 2024, there's also a chance that XRP could soar in price this year. Last summer, when XRP scored a major legal win in its ongoing SEC court case, the price of XRP doubled nearly overnight. So, there is upside potential. If you're currently holding XRP tokens, it could be worth waiting to see what develops.\n\nOver a long-term horizon, though, Solana appears to be a far superior investment. As soon as Solana flipped XRP at year-end, that should have been a wake-up call to XRP investors. It's finally time to look for a new crypto champion, and right now, that champion appears to be Solana.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Solana right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Solana, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Solana wasn't one of them.

        "content": "In a recent development in the volatile cryptocurrency space, an Ethereum whale has made a substantial move, transferring about 15,000 ETH, valued at approximately $37 million, to the leading crypto exchange, Coinbase. The blockchain transactions tracking platform, Whale Alert, brought attention to this significant transfer, igniting curiosity among crypto enthusiasts and triggering a drop in Ethereum\u2019s market price.\n\nEthereum Whale Move Triggers Concern On Price\n\nWhale Alert reported the transfer of 14,699 ETH, equivalent to $37.58 million, from an unknown wallet to Coinbase, raising eyebrows in the crypto community. This sizable movement seems to have impacted the current performance of Ethereum, as witnessed by the recent price of ETH.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOn the other hand, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez has also shared his views on the Ethereum price on the X platform recently. According to Martinez, if the ETH price cannot maintain its position above the $2,530 mark, it may witness a further slip to the $2,450 level.\n\nMeanwhile, the crypto market is now on edge as Ethereum currently flirts around the $2,550 mark. Notably, analysts and investors are closely monitoring Ethereum\u2019s price movements following this significant whale transaction.\n\nAlso Read: Binance Dethroned As Indian Traders Flock To Local Firms Amid Regulatory Scrutiny\n\nA Closer Look Into Price & Other Developments\n\nThe price concern is compounded by the observations from CryptoQuant data, revealing that Ethereum\u2019s Coinbase premium index, measuring the gap between Ethereum\u2019s dollar-denominated price on Coinbase and its USDT-denominated price on Binance, fell to -0.51, marking its lowest level since December 31, 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, this heightened Coinbase premium index adds another layer of uncertainty to Ethereum\u2019s short-term future, raising questions about potential further price drops. As the market anticipates the next move, crypto enthusiasts brace for potential turbulence, with the $2,450 threshold becoming a critical level to watch.\n\nNotably, as of writing, the Ethereum price traded at $2,554.15, down 1.42% over the last 24 hours. However, its trading volume from yesterday rose 26% to $24.22 billion at the same time. The ETH price has touched a high of $2,710.42 and a low of $2,460.93 over the last 24 hours.\n\nAlso Read: GameStop to Shutdown Its NFT Marketplace Amid Regulatory Scrutiny"

        "title": "Ethereum Eclipses Bitcoin In A Crypto Coup: Has The King Been Dethroned? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The winds of change are swirling through the once-Bitcoin-dominated cryptocurrency landscape, as Ethereum (ETH) stages a stunning rally, leaving the reigning king, Bitcoin (BTC), in its wake.\n\nJust days after the highly anticipated approval of Bitcoin\u2019s spot ETF, a paradoxical scene unfolds: ETH soars 13.5%, scaling a 9-month high above $2,650, while BTC stumbles with a 10% dip. This unexpected turn of events has sent shockwaves through the crypto community, igniting a fierce debate \u2013 is Ethereum finally usurping Bitcoin\u2019s throne?\n\nWhile the Bitcoin ETF approval was initially heralded as a game-changer, its muted impact left investors bewildered. This begs the question: what hidden forces are propelling Ethereum\u2019s meteoric rise? Several factors seem to be fueling this ETH revolution:\n\nTech Titans Take Notice\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, often shrouded in an aura of anonymity and regulatory uncertainty, Ethereum is increasingly embracing a collaborative, future-oriented approach. Upcoming technological advancements like the \u201cDencun\u201d hard fork promise enhanced data availability and reduced transaction costs, while account abstraction paves the way for smoother user experiences and secure social logins.\n\nLarry Fink is already beating the Ethereum drum. One day after the Bitcoin launch. The rotation is real. https://t.co/5Ctvqqqauy \u2014 The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) January 12, 2024\n\nThese innovations are attracting the attention of tech giants like BlackRock, whose CEO, Larry Fink, recently expressed \u201cseeing value\u201d in a potential Ethereum ETF. This institutional validation adds significant fuel to the ETH fire.\n\nEthereum Staking Rewards And Scarcity\n\nUnlike its proof-of-work rival, Ethereum rewards its holders with attractive annualized staking rewards (around 4.3%). This incentivizes investors to lock up their ETH in the network, effectively reducing supply and pushing the price up. Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s issuance rate is slightly negative, further contributing to its scarcity and increasing its appeal as a valuable asset.\n\nEthereum currently trading at $2,540.5 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nOutpacing The Competition\n\nWhile Bitcoin grapples with its identity crisis, Ethereum thrives in a bustling ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) and blockchain-based projects. This vibrant network effect creates a self-reinforcing loop, attracting developers, users, and investors, and solidifying Ethereum\u2019s position as the go-to platform for innovation in the blockchain space.\n\nMeanwhile, direct competitors like BNB and SOL have encountered recent stumbles, further highlighting Ethereum\u2019s relative strength and resilience.\n\nEther/USD vs. BTC/USD, SOL/USD, and BNB/USD. Source: TradingView\n\nThe ETF Factor Looms Large\n\nThough still shrouded in uncertainty, the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval later this year adds another layer of intrigue to the story. With BlackRock openly advocating for it, and regulatory hurdles potentially clearing by May, the prospect of an influx of institutional capital into the Ethereum market has investors salivating.\n\nHowever, the crypto world is as unpredictable as a rollercoaster. While Ethereum\u2019s current trajectory is undeniably impressive, challenges remain. Regulatory hurdles, potential network upgrades, and broader market fluctuations could all disrupt its momentum.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin, though seemingly faltering, still boasts a massive market cap and a loyal following. It\u2019s too early to write off the digital gold just yet.\n\nThe battle for crypto supremacy has entered a fascinating new chapter. Ethereum, armed with technological prowess, staking rewards, and a burgeoning ecosystem, appears poised to challenge Bitcoin\u2019s long-held dominance.\n\nBut whether it can dethrone the king and claim the crown remains to be seen. This crypto saga, still unfolding with every traded byte, promises to keep us on the edge of our seats, wondering who will ultimately rule the digital kingdom.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "On the heels of the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler is exercising caution on Ethereum.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, Gensler addressed the possibility of a spot Ethereum ETF gaining SEC approval in the future. While acknowledging the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, he emphasized that this was specific to Bitcoin as a non-security commodity token.\n\nHe carefully refrained from providing further insights on an Ethereum ETF but hinted at a distinction between Bitcoin\u2019s commodity status and the potential classification of other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), as securities.\n\n[CNBC] Gary Gensler asserts that #Bitcoin is a highly speculative and volatile asset frequently utilized for illicit activities pic.twitter.com/YvgkuhjWOt \u2014 BecauseBitcoin.com (@BecauseBitcoin) January 12, 2024\n\nGensler has long maintained Bitcoin\u2019s status as a commodity, outside the SEC\u2019s direct purview, while the agency has yet to officially determine Ethereum\u2019s security status.\n\nLegal filings indicate the SEC\u2019s inclination to view Ethereum transactions under its jurisdiction. If Ethereum were classified as a security, it could face increased regulatory scrutiny, potentially making the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF more challenging than that of Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nYou might also like: BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink points to value in Ethereum ETFs, crypto asset class\n\nDespite Gensler\u2019s reservations, recent legal judgments, including a federal appeals court decision ordering the SEC to review a Bitcoin ETF application, may influence the regulatory landscape for crypto ETFs. This legal shift could have implications for Ethereum, especially considering the SEC\u2019s prior approval of an Ethereum futures ETF.\n\nNEW: JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon says \"#Bitcoin doesn't have value.\"\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, JP Morgan is an authorized participant for BlackRock's spot #Bitcoin ETF \ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/W5MWONMOOE \u2014 Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) January 10, 2024\n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon also appeared on CNBC to discuss the crypto industry\u2019s latest developments.

        "content": "JPMorgan has expressed skepticism regarding the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by May. In a recent interview, Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a figure at JPMorgan, emphasized the SEC\u2019s need to categorize Ethereum as a commodity akin to Bitcoin to facilitate such approval. However, Panigirtzoglou conveyed his reservations, stating,\n\n\u201cThis is far from given, and I wouldn\u2019t put more than a 50% chance to the SEC classifying Ethereum as a commodity before May.\u201d advertisement\n\nComparison with Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe context of this uncertainty stems from the SEC\u2019s recent move to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs, marking a significant shift after a decade of rejections. Ethereum\u2019s market dynamics have shown a notable surge, with a nearly 18% increase in its price over the last week. However, at press time, ETH had fallen under bearish pressure, exchanging hands at $2,591.62, a 0.82% decline from the intra-day high.\n\nDespite these positive market indicators and the success of Bitcoin ETFs, the SEC\u2019s approach to cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin remains cautious and, as Panigirtzoglou suggests, is still skewed towards viewing them as securities.\n\nImplications of Ethereum\u2019s Staking Protocols\n\nThe debate over Ethereum\u2019s classification is further complicated by its transition to staking protocols. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has previously indicated that tokens using such protocols could fall under the category of securities. This stance was evident during a congressional hearing last year, where Gensler refrained from categorically defining Ethereum\u2019s status.\n\nMoreover, while approving Bitcoin ETFs, Gensler\u2019s remarks did not hint at a similar openness towards other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s Stance on Ethereum ETF Contradicted\n\nDespite JPMorgan\u2019s cautious outlook, other market analysts, like Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s James Seyffart, hold a more optimistic view on the approval of Ethereum ETFs. The recent filings for spot ETH ETFs by major firms such as BlackRock and Fidelity underscore this optimism.\n\nMoreover,, BlackRock\u2019s CEO Larry Fink has acknowledged the potential for an Ethereum ETF in the United States following the successful launch of their Bitcoin ETF, which saw impressive trading volumes.\n\nRead Also: Bitcoin Price Slips 6% to Hit $43500, Is Sell-the-News Strategy in Action?"

        "content": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission finally greenlighted a spot Bitcoin ETF earlier this week, although in a slightly reluctant fashion.\n\nNow, speculations are starting to arise on when the agency will do the same in terms of an exchange-traded fund tracking the performance of the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nWhen ETH ETF?\n\n2023 will go down in history as the year with the most news and developments in terms of ETFs as numerous companies filed for such products for BTC and ETH. Perhaps the trend intensified after BlackRock did so in the middle of the year, and many others followed.\n\nWith already nearly a dozen BTC ETFs trading on US stock markets, the focus has now shifted to other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum. Currently, several companies have filed to launch such products, including Grayscale, which is trying to convert its ETH Trust into a spot ETF, as it did with its flagship Trust \u2013 GBTC.\n\nThe SEC, though, keeps delaying the decision, with most applications now having to wait until May. History shows that the Commission tends to delay or reject crypto ETFs for years before it finally allows them to reach the markets, but will this be the case now as well?\n\nThe analytics platform Santiment took it to X to check with the community about their opinion on the matter. It turns out that the majority, over 52% in fact, believe the US will have a spot Ethereum ETF by the end of this year. Roughly 10% are even more optimistic, saying it will be greenlighted this month, while 11.3% don\u2019t see it happening ever.\n\n\ud83e\udd14 With several #Bitcoin #ETF\u2018s being approved by the #SEC Wednesday, there are growing hopes that #Ethereum and other assets will have their own ETF\u2019s approved next. When do you believe another asset, $ETH or otherwise, have their own ETF be officially accepted for public use? \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 12, 2024\n\nPrice Effects?\n\nWe saw that BTC skyrocketed in the months ahead of the SEC approvals and even on the first day of trading. However, the trend reversed violently in the following day or so, and the asset slumped by almost $8,000 in 36 hours when the ETFs were already live for trading.\n\nThis has given those in camp \u201csell-the-news\u201d advantage so far. ETH, on the other hand, has just now started to increase in value, which could be a speculative run as many expect an ETF to arrive soon.\n\nAs such, it would be interesting to follow how ETH\u2019s price will perform in the months prior and after such a product is approved, if ever."

        "content": "Ethereum has staged a remarkable coup, outshining Bitcoin with a 14% surge in just two weeks. This week, the digital currency shattered a key psychological barrier, surpassing $2,600 for the first time since May 2022. This decisive breach, backed by strong fundamentals and an increasingly bullish sentiment, could pave the way for Ethereum\u2019s ascent to a coveted $3,000 mark.\n\nEthereum Breaches Critical Psychological Barrier\n\nThe $2,600 level wasn\u2019t just a random resistance point; it represented a critical psychological hurdle for Ethereum. Breaching this level not only confirmed the ongoing uptrend but also triggered a cascade of technical buy signals, propelling the price even higher.

With its robust fundamentals, technical momentum, and the promise of an ETF, Ethereum is poised to claim its rightful place as the dominant force in the digital currency landscape.\n\nThe recent $2,600 breach could be the first step on a journey towards even greater heights, and investors around the world are watching with bated breath.\n\nFeatured image from Pixabay\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

In a recent CNBC interview, Fink acknowledged the value of an Ethereum ETF, signaling a significant shift in institutional interest towards the cryptocurrency.\n\nBlackRock, commanding an impressive $10 trillion in assets under management, has highlighted the importance of these ETFs, envisioning them as pivotal connectors between traditional finance and the evolving crypto sector.\n\n\ud83d\udea8NEW: @BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to @FoxBusiness\u2019s @CGasparino on #Bitcoin: \u269c\ufe0fIf you\u2019re fearful of your government, or worrying your government is devaluing the currency, then you could see this as a great potential long-term store of value.

        "title": "We asked ChatGPT what will be ETH price if Ethereum ETF is approved - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "United States regulators finally approved the highly awaited spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), with analysts expressing that this move opens up more opportunities for the cryptocurrency sector. Indeed, there is a bullish sentiment regarding the product\u2019s long-term impact, mainly due to its potential to attract institutional investors.\n\nIn this context, there are speculations that such a product will likely spill over to other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum (ETH), the second-ranked cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Analysts are also speculating that there is a possibility of a spot Ethereum ETF getting approved in 2024.\n\nWith the product likely to impact the value of ETH, Finbold consulted the generative artificial intelligence (AI) tool ChatGPT by OpenAI to provide a possible price trajectory for Ethereum. If the product is approved, the tool offered bullish and bearish scenarios for Ethereum.\n\nBullish scenario\n\nAccording to the tool, if a spot Ethereum ETF secures regulatory approval, it could mark a pivotal moment for Ethereum. Increased institutional interest and mainstream adoption may attract investors seeking exposure to Ethereum without direct ownership.\n\nThe ETF\u2019s approval could generate a surge in demand, fostering positive sentiment and confidence in Ethereum.\n\nIn this optimistic scenario, ChatGPT pointed out that Ethereum\u2019s price might experience a significant surge but acknowledged the challenges of identifying the exact valuation of the asset. Nevertheless, the AI tool noted that the cryptocurrency could potentially reach levels above $3,000.\n\nThe tool, however, cautioned that the bullish outlook depends on market dynamics, institutional interest, and broader cryptocurrency trends.\n\nEthereum ChatGPT bullish price prediction. Source: ChatGPT.\n\nBearish scenario\n\nContrary to expectations, approving a spot Ethereum ETF might not guarantee sustained positive market sentiment. The tool suggested that traders and investors could opt to \u201csell the news,\u201d leading to a short-term price correction.\n\nAdditionally, regulatory uncertainties or concerns about the ETF\u2019s structure might create skepticism among market participants.\n\nChatGPT noted that Ethereum could face a temporary decline in a bearish scenario. The price might drop below its current trading levels, ranging from $2,300 to $2,000 or even lower, depending on the extent of market reactions.\n\nEthereum spot ETF Potential\n\nIndeed, prominent figures in the financial world suggest that an Ethereum ETF could be monumental. Specifically, BlackRock\u2019s (NYSE: BLK) CEO Larry Fink noted that he \u2018sees value\u2019 in a spot Ethereum ETF following the successful launch of the Bitcoin ETF.\n\nIt is worth noting that BlackRock, the largest investment management firm in the world, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot in Ethereum ETF in November of last year.\n\nMoreover, decisions on spot Ethereum ETF applications are anticipated from the SEC starting in May. Apart from BlackRock, other notable firms in line for approval include Invesco, Ark, and VanEck, alongside Grayscale, which aims to convert its existing Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into an ETF.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum faces heightened buying pressure, contrasting with Bitcoin\u2019s weakening trend following the ETF approval.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nBy press time, Ethereum was trading at $2,548, reflecting weekly gains exceeding 13%.\n\nETH seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nIn terms of technical analysis, the asset is characterized by bullish sentiments. A summary of the one-day gauges retrieved from TradingView indicates a \u2018buy\u2019 rating at 15, with moving averages signaling a \u2018strong buy\u2019 at 13. Additionally, oscillators are holding a \u2018neutral\u2019 position at 8.\n\nETH technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nIn conclusion, the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF has potentially increased the likelihood of witnessing a similar product for Ethereum. However, the impact on the price of Ethereum will likely be influenced by the overall market sentiment at the same time.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

Despite recording a series of downward trends in the preceding days, Ethereum regained its stability soon to register significant price appreciation just before the spot ETF approval.\n\nEthereum sees a bullish trend\n\nFollowing the flash crash on 3 January, Ethereum faced challenges in recovering, dropping to the $2,200-price range. However, as news of the Bitcoin ETF approval circulated, Ethereum\u2019s price rebounded. On the daily timeframe chart, a noticeable uptrend began on 8 January, resulting in a 4.95% hike, pushing the price beyond $2,300.\n\nFurthermore, on the day of the ETF announcement, Ethereum went over $2,500, underlining a more than 10% increase. Comparatively, Bitcoin, with its ETF approval, noted a hike of less than 2%. This suggested that the impact on ETH\u2019s value was comparatively more positive.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum was trading above $2,600.

The volume began its hike around 9 January, touching a peak on 11 January. On this day, the volume surged to over $31 billion, marking the highest level observed in over five months. At press time too, the volume remained high and was over $19 billion.\n\nThis trend in volume indicates high trading activity, with buyers displaying a more aggressive approach in the market.\n\nEthereum supply in profit goes past 86%\n\nThe price decline significantly affected Ethereum\u2019s profitability, as shown by Santiment\u2019s chart. However, following the subsequent price recovery, the supply in profit registered an increase. During the price downturn, the supply in profit fell to around 80%. On the contrary, it saw a notable surge soon after, climbing close to 87% on 11 January.\n\nAt the time of writing, figures for the same were around 86.2%, equivalent to over 113 million.

With the crypto market set to explode, investors have been urged to HODL. Gaining a head start is Ethereum (ETH), with its surge creating quite a buzz in the crypto scene. Meanwhile, Internet Computer (ICP), another top altcoin, is trading on the downside, facing strong bearish pressure. Worthy of note is NuggetRush (NUGX), a new ICO fast becoming a safe haven among investors.\n\nThis post will discuss the diverging trajectories of Ethereum and Internet Computer. Further, it will cover why NuggetRush is one of the best cryptos to buy now.\n\n>> Buy NuggetRush Now <<\n\nNuggetRush (NUGX): A New Investor Haven\n\nFlying under the radar is NuggetRush (NUGX), one of the new ICOs with the biggest potential. Still in its early stages, it is fast becoming a safe haven for investors seeking low risk and staggering gains.\n\nAlthough it combines memetic features, it has an edge over most hype-driven coin offerings. This is because it will be more than just a meme, as its ecosystem will boast real-world applications and the token will have strong use cases.\n\nPositioned at the intersection of memes, play-to-earn (P2E), and GameFi, it has been hailed as the most promising narrative. The ecosystem will host a thrilling gold mining game, which promises an immersive gameplay experience and opportunities to earn tangible rewards. The NUGX coin will function as the in-game currency as well as a governance token.\n\nIn the fourth round of the presale, a token is priced at $0.015. According to experts, its price will rally by 60x after its launch, which makes it the best new crypto to invest in today.\n\n>> Buy NuggetRush Now <<\n\nEthereum (ETH): One of the Best Coins to Hold\n\nEthereum (ETH) is on a roll following the significant surge in its price. Holders are giving themselves a tap on the back for holding amid bearish pressure and sentiment. With the fear of missing out (FOMO) expected to rise in the future, Ethereum is still a good crypto to buy at its current price.\n\nAs a bull market approaches, Ethereum has been tipped as one of the altcoins to watch. Given its staggering upside potential, it is a wave you shouldn\u2019t miss out on. So, if you have yet to add ETH to your crypto portfolio, this might be a reminder to do so.\n\nInternet Computer (ICP): Anticipated Rally in the Coming Days\n\nAfter a significant rally in the price of the Internet Computer (ICP), it is now exposed to the downside. The crypto market moving sideways isn\u2019t uncommon, so the dip in the price of Internet Computer isn\u2019t shocking.\n\nDespite the recent price dip, many remain optimistic. According to experts, Internet Computer will make a comeback in the coming days. Hence, you can see its current low price as an opportunity to add more ICP tokens to your bag at a discounted price.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum is soaring ahead of most altcoins, which is great news if you are a current holder. On the other hand, Internet Computer is facing bearish pressure, although a bounceback is on the cards. Meanwhile, NuggetRush has emerged as one of the altcoins to watch.\n\nVisit NuggetRush Presale Website"

        "title": "Ethereum ETF Prospects Not as Bright as Bitcoin's; Here's Why - CoinGape",
        "content": "The journey toward approving an Ethereum ETF stands on shaky ground when compared to the recent launch of Bitcoin ETF. While the BTC ETF launch took nearly a debate and a few lawsuits, SEC Chair Gary Gensler never called Bitcoin anything other than a commodity.\n\nBut, Gensler weighs caution on how he defines Ethereum.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhen Gensler deemed Bitcoin a non-security commodity, it became akin to gold and silver. But Ethereum\u2019s classification remained ambiguous, clouding the prospects for its own ETF.\n\nBitcoin is a loner among its peers\n\nIn a recent interview with CNBC, Gensler\u2019s comments have set a precedent for the market once again by recognizing Bitcoin as the lone crypto commodity, suggesting that an Ethereum ETF may face tougher scrutiny.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWhat we did this week\u2026 it\u2019s happened to one non-security commodity token called Bitcoin,\u201d positioning Bitcoin as unique among its peers.\n\nGensler added, \u201cLike we\u2019ve had gold spot exchange-traded products and silver exchange-traded products in the past and approved in the past.\u201d\n\nThis clarification comes amidst the SEC\u2019s rigorous debate on what is deemed a security. It is especially highlighted by the Ripple case, with several community arguments partly resting on Ethereum\u2019s status.\n\nETH ETF approval odds lower than BTC\n\nGensler\u2019s careful language suggests that the SEC is not ready to categorically separate Ethereum from the potential label of a security, which would require all its transactions to be either registered or exempt from registration.\n\nWhile Gensler has openly categorized Bitcoin as a commodity, his reluctance to speak on individual tokens like Ethereum signals complexity. This ambiguity could cast a shadow on the expectations for an Ethereum ETF by May.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, reportedly places a 70% chance of approval by May for the ETH ETF. It is a dip from the more favorable odds given to Bitcoin at 90%.\n\nUpcoming deadlines in 2024\n\nThe list of Ethereum ETF proposals awaiting SEC decisions this year calls for clarity sooner.

        "content": "1inch experienced a substantial surge in volumes and market dominance in the fourth quarter of last year amidst a broader market resurgence,\n\nAccording to Messari\u2019s report, the popular DEX aggregator recorded over $30 billion in executed volume and a commanding 64% share of the Ethereum DEX aggregator market. The nearly doubled volume from external sources suggests increased adoption of 1inch as a backend solution and the expansion of aggregator platforms.\n\n1inch Sees Increased Trading Activity in Q4\n\nTransaction growth is primarily attributed to new products, as evidenced by increased activity in the Limit Order Protocol (LOP) and 1inch Fusion, while transactions in the Aggregation Protocol witnessed a decline during the quarter.\n\nThe share of 1inch trades conducted on Uniswap V3 and V2 saw an increase by 8 and 3 percentage points, constituting 40% of trades and 8% of trade volume, respectively. The volume generated by 1inch on these two Uniswap versions rose from $5.6 billion in Q3 to $10 billion in Q4, Messari\u2019s report noted.\n\nThe share was mainly derived from Curve and Dodo, the second and now sixth most common execution venues. PancakeSwap continued to receive over $1 billion in trade volume from 1inch for the second consecutive quarter, accounting for 7% of 1inch\u2019s total volume in Q4.\n\nDuring the period, 1inch experienced notably greater volume growth compared to its counterparts, leading to an expansion of its market share from 59% of trades in Q3\u201923 to 63% in Q4\u201923.\n\nThe sole significant competitor to gain market share in Q4 was CoW Swap, holding 11% of the aggregator volume on Ethereum during the quarter. ParaSwap and 0x, in turn, held 11% and 10% of the aggregator volume, respectively, in Q4.\n\n1inch DAO\n\nThroughout Q4, the 1inch DAO continued its strategic treasury management, diversifying its stablecoin holdings by swapping a million USDC for DAI. These funds were then deposited to earn interest as sDAI, constituting the first reallocation since the Q2 deposit of 1 million USDC in Aave for interest.\n\nOn the expenditure front, the DAO used slightly over $1 million in three distinct transactions. Notably, on December 30, $890,000 USDC was allocated to fund support services for users within the 1inch Network.\n\nMeanwhile, the staked amount of 1INCH saw a 7% increase in the fourth quarter."

        "content": "The percentage of ETH circulating supply in profit now sits at the highest level in 2021.\n\nThis has been fueled by the recent uptick in the coin\u2019s price.\n\nThe percentage of Ethereum [ETH] circulating supply in profit has skyrocketed to its highest level since 2021, data from Glassnode has shown.\n\nAccording to data from CoinMarketCap, the coin\u2019s circulating supply is 120,181,204 ETH. At press time, 91.6% of this total, equivalent to 110,085,982 ETH, was in profit.\n\nThe rally in the percentage of ETH\u2019s supply in profit is attributable to the recent surge in the coin\u2019s price. The value rise comes on the heels of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) recent approval of a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nExchanging hands at $2,550, ETH\u2019s value has risen by almost 10% since the ETF approval arrived on 10th January.\n\nWhile the rise in the number of coins held in profit is generally considered a bullish signal, the disparity in the trading strategies commonly adopted by ETH\u2019s short and long-term holders might impact where the coin\u2019s price might be headed next.\n\nSome profit-takers, especially short-term traders, might be tempted to sell their ETH to lock in their gains. This could lead to temporary price dips if selling pressure outweighs buying.\n\nOn the other hand, long-term holders looking to gain more profit might be more inclined to hold their ETH, reducing the circulating supply and potentially contributing to price appreciation in the long term.\n\nETH on a weekly chart\n\nThe ETH market assessed on a seven-day chart revealed that sentiment remained significantly bullish. The key momentum indicators observed were spotted at overbought highs, suggesting that buying activity outpaced coin sell-offs.\n\nFor example, ETH\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 70.98, while its Money Flow Index (MFI) was 84.65. Likewise, the coin\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) was 0.17 at press time, indicating steady capital inflow.\n\nConfirming that the bulls had control of the weekly chart, ETH\u2019s positive directional index (green) at 30.74 rested above its negative directional index (red) at 8.67.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nWith the coin\u2019s Aroon Up Line (orange) spotted at 100%, the current bullish trend was strong.\n\nWhen an asset\u2019s Aroon Up line is close to 100, it indicates that the uptrend is strong and that the most recent high was reached relatively recently."

Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nThe historical and hotly anticipated approval of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) this week basically blocked out the sun for the rest of the crypto solar system, and frankly fueled a flood of headlines at Decrypt.\n\nAll the theories and analysis over what the approval would mean for the value of the top cryptocurrency was finally put to the test. Up or down? Priced in or not? Would Bitcoin enter the next phase of its evolution, or simply shrug? After all, Bitcoin spot ETFs aren't exactly new outside the U.S.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn the question of up or down, the answer is so far both: The price of Bitcoin flirted across a crowded room with $49,000 when the ETFs were approved. One day later, though, and it plunged back to $43,000\u2014a neighborhood where it's been hanging out for quite a while.\n\nTrading just below $43,000 now, Bitcoin is down about 2% from where it was seven days ago. Over the past month, BTC is totally flat. But hodlers are still happy to see Bitcoin up over 120% since this time last year.\n\nPerennial \"distant second\" Ethereum saw more green candles, by comparison, buoyed in part by a rise in \"wen ETH ETF?\" speculation now that the Bitcoin version exists. Ethereum hit an 18-month high of nearly $2,700 yesterday.\n\nETH is changing hands at $2,568 today, a rise of about 1% from this time yesterday. But over the last week, it's up over 14%, and up more than 12% for the last month. The one-year return is about 80%. Ethereum scaling networks also had a strong week, with Arbitrum (ARB) up 22% and Optimism (OP) popping 16%.\n\nElsewhere in the top 5, Binance Coin (BNB) is down just under 2% this week while Solana has posted a 2% gain. Some other crypto bright spots include Tezos (XTZ) and Stacks (STX), both posting double-digit percentage gains over the past week.\n\nInterestingly, the Ethereum Name Service and its ENS token\u2014at the very back of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap\u2014had the best week, up nearly 75% over the last seven days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

However, Ethereum [ETH] had other plans, as it registered double-digit growth in the last seven days.\n\nWill investors witness a fresh bull rally during the upcoming week?\n\nThe aftermath of ETF approval\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, ETH was up by more than 13% in the last seven days. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $2,543.60 with a market capitalization of over $305 billion. Sentiment around the token also turned positive.\n\nMoreover, on the 13th of January, Santiment posted that sentiment toward top-capital assets such as Ethereum remained at extremely optimistic levels.\n\n\ud83d\udcca As the weekend has kicked off, sentiment toward top cap assets remain at extremely optimistic levels with spotlights on them following the #ETF approvals.

Ethereum\u2019s Weighted Sentiment registered a massive spike last week, meaning that bullish sentiment was dominant.\n\nInterestingly, despite the hike in bullish sentiment, ETH\u2019s social volume registered a drop in the recent past.\n\nWhat to expect from Ethereum\n\nTo better understand whether the high bullish sentiment would result in a further hike in the token\u2019s price, AMBCrypto took a deeper look at Ethereum\u2019s state.\n\nOur analysis revealed that ETH\u2019s Supply on Exchanges recently went below its Supply outside of Exchanges, meaning that buying pressure on the token was high.\n\nWhales\u2019 confidence in the token also somewhat increased as its supply held by top addresses went up slightly last week.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Bollinger Bands revealed that its price was in a high-volatility zone. Additionally, its MACD also displayed a clear bullish advantage in the market, increasing the chances of a continued price uptick in the days to follow.\n\nHowever, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered a downtick in the recent past, which could restrict ETH\u2019s price from moving up.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nIf Ethereum manages to push its price further up, the token might face a few resistance zones. Therefore, AMBCrypto took a look at ETH\u2019s liquidation heat map.\n\nAs per our analysis, if an ETH bull rally is bound to happen, the token would face strong resistance near the $2,740 mark, as previously, the token\u2019s liquidation spiked at that level."

Despite Bitcoin\u2019s stable pricing in the $45K-$47K range, the altcoin market witnessed a surge, notably Ethereum Classic (ETC) soaring by 48%, leading the way for other major altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), and Avalanche (AVAX) with double-digit gains.\n\nSo, what\u2019s next for the market? Here\u2019s all you must know to navigate the future!\n\nAltcoins Pick Pace\n\nThe recent rally in altcoin prices is fueled by rising expectations within the crypto community about the SEC\u2019s potential approval of spot-based ETFs for alternative cryptocurrencies. Crypto analyst Lark Davis, known as \u201cCrypto Lark,\u201d speculates Ethereum spot ETFs might gain approval around May, a significant development for the second-largest cryptocurrency. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas puts the odds of an Ethereum ETF in May at 70%.\n\nEthereum spot ETFs coming in May (first final deadline from SEC)!\n\n\n\nETH futures already approved\u2026 so that means ETH is already classified as not a security.\n\n\n\nEIP 4844 coming to lower layer two fees big time!\n\n\n\nBitcoin halving coming\u2026\n\n\n\nProbably an XRP ETF as it is also not a\u2026 \u2014 Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) January 13, 2024\n\nMiles Jennings, A16Z general counsel, suggests that the SEC\u2019s approval of Ethereum futures products signals a favorable stance on Ethereum, steering clear of classification as a security.\n\nAlso Read: XRP Bulls Well in Position: Can They Trigger a Fresh Upswing to Hit $1 in January 2024?\n\nIs An XRP ETF Coming?\n\nFollowing the Ripple SEC lawsuit\u2019s landmark ruling declaring XRP not a security, Crypto Lark considers the potential for an XRP ETF. The crypto community eagerly awaits the next major ETF approval post-Bitcoin, with Steve McClurg, co-founder and CIO of Valkyrie Funds, dropping hints about potential Ethereum or XRP ETFs.\n\n2024 \u2013 The Year We Hit the Biggest Milestones!\n\nBeyond these groundbreaking developments, 2024 promises other significant events, including the Ethereum Dencun upgrade and the Bitcoin halving. Analysts paint a bullish picture of an altcoin boom in 2024. Lark Davis envisions it as \u201cthe biggest altcoin party ever seen.\u201d This optimism draws parallels to historical precedents, where the SEC\u2019s approval of BTC futures funds triggered a spectacular rally in altcoins, soaring over 500%.\n\nIf history repeats itself, Ethereum, XRP, and other altcoins could experience substantial growth in 2024, potentially overshadowing Bitcoin in market dominance. The crypto community stands at the brink of a year filled with anticipation. Folks, we\u2019re in for a wild ride. We\u2019re excited \u2013 are you?"

        "content": "Larry Fink thinks a spot Ethereum ETF has value.\n\nETH rose in dominance on the back of the spot BTC ETF approval.\n\nThe approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF has led to speculation about increased possibilities for other assets to have their spot ETFs, particularly Ethereum [ETH]. The CEO of BlackRock recently expressed this sentiment during an interview.\n\nA matter of when for a spot Ethereum ETF\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently expressed his perspective on ETFs. He said there is \u201cvalue in having an Ethereum ETF\u201d in a recent CNBC interview following the approval of the spot BTC ETFs.\n\nNotably, BlackRock itself has secured approvals for a spot BTC ETF.\n\nOn the first trading day, the spot BTC ETF recorded a substantial volume of around $4.6 billion. The potential for institutions to pursue a spot ETH ETF is buoyed by the absence of any regulatory issues between Ethereum and the SEC.\n\nUnlike certain exchanges and crypto assets that have faced SEC charges in the past, ETH has had no such issues.\n\nFurthermore, ETH holds the second-largest market capitalization, as per CoinMarketCap. This makes it an attractive asset for institutions to consider offering as an ETF.\n\nEthereum rally cut short post-ETF\n\nAn examination of the daily timeframe chart for Ethereum showed a significant rally leading up to the approval of the spot BTC ETF. The positive trend continued on the first day of ETF trading, approaching the overbought zone.\n\nHowever, this upward trend paused on 12th January, marked by a decline of over 3%. Initially poised to break the $2,700 price range, ETH retraced back to around $2,500.\n\nAs of this writing, ETH was trading at around $2,540, reflecting a slight increase of over 1%.\n\nEthereum takes space in the crypto discourse\n\nAn examination of Ethereum\u2019s social dominance on Santiment showed its dominance in discussions within the crypto space.\n\nOn 10th January, the social dominance rose to over 9.4%. This signified that ETH accounted for more than 9% of the overall discourse in the space. However, as of this writing, the dominance has reduced to around 7%.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nThe chart showed a noteworthy correlation between the increase in Ethereum\u2019s social dominance and its price increase.\n\nAdditionally, ETH played a key role in leading the broader altcoin rally, further showing its significance within the crypto space."

        "content": "In a week etched in crypto history, the long-awaited arrival of Bitcoin ETFs in the US sent shockwaves through the market. Yet, despite the monumental achievement, the king of crypto, Bitcoin, took a step back on Saturday, dipping 6% to end the week barely above $43,000.\n\nMany analysts predicted a \u201csell-the-news\u201d scenario, where investors cashed in on profits built upon anticipation of the ETF approval. Others suggest a rotation into Ethereum, which surged 15% on the week and touched highs not seen since May 2022.\n\nEthereum ETF Speculation: Shaping Crypto Narratives\n\nThis speculation is fueled by expectations of imminent Ethereum ETF decisions from the SEC, potentially mirroring the winds that propelled Bitcoin towards a 60% rally in recent months.\n\nAccording to Alex Saunders, a Citi analyst, the cryptocurrency market has transitioned to a new narrative, as Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin. This surge is believed to be driven by anticipation that the second-largest cryptocurrency could receive approval for an ETF.\n\n\u201cIn our view, the crypto market has already moved to the next narrative, with ETH rallying more than bitcoin, likely on the expectation that crypto\u2019s second largest token could also see an ETF approval,\u201d Saunders said.\n\nWhile the immediate price action might paint a contrasting picture, the significance of the ETF launch for Bitcoin\u2019s long-term trajectory remains undeniable. Market participants across the board agree that ETFs will pave the way for increased institutional adoption, a crucial step towards legitimizing Bitcoin as a serious asset class.\n\nBitcoin slightly below the $43K level today. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nAnalysts at Citi anticipate \u201cextra prominence\u201d for Bitcoin in diversified portfolios, although widespread inclusion is still some distance away.\n\nThe road to crypto acceptance, however, isn\u2019t paved solely with Bitcoin. Litecoin, often dubbed \u201csilver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold,\u201d emerged as another bright spot this week, on track for an impressive 11% gain. This signifies diversification within the crypto landscape, a trend likely to continue with the potential influx of other crypto ETFs.\n\nBTC 24-hour price action. Source: Coingecko\n\nCrypto Equities Shake Amidst Bitcoin\u2019s Slide\n\nBeyond the digital coins themselves, the news wasn\u2019t as rosy for crypto-related equities and miners. Coinbase and MicroStrategy, heavily invested in Bitcoin, took tumbles of 6% and 8%, respectively. Miners, already on the back foot after suffering substantial losses on Thursday, extended their descent, with CleanSpark and Iris Energy experiencing double-digit drops.\n\nThis market snapshot illustrates the dynamic nature of the crypto ecosystem. While Bitcoin might have taken a breather after its historic week, the overall sentiment remains positive. Ethereum\u2019s ascent and the anticipation of broader ETF access signal a shift in investor focus, suggesting a future where the crypto playing field isn\u2019t solely Bitcoin\u2019s domain.\n\nThe dust settles on Bitcoin\u2019s ETF debut, leaving a wobbly king and a market yearning for the next narrative. Ethereum, bathed in its own ETF hopes, gleams like a challenger. In this dance of highs and lows, understanding the evolving stories matters more than chasing fleeting profits. Bitcoin\u2019s wobble may yet be a prelude to a high-flying future. The crypto saga, after all, has only just begun.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The Bitcoin spot ETF approval brought volatility to the cryptocurrency market, mostly favoring altcoins for the weekend. Meanwhile, smart money in and outflows hint at which cryptocurrencies profitable traders are accumulating and getting rid of.\n\nIn onchain analysis, smart traders are active crypto addresses with a profitable history considering tokens\u2019 inflow and outflow. If the address acquired tokens at a lower average price than what they later spent, it is smart money.\n\nNotably, the smart money inflow was massively dominated by Ethereum (ETH) in the past 24 hours, according to SpotOnChain data. $78.87 million in ETH entered smart traders\u2019 accounts, while the second place had only a $3.25 million inflow.\n\nSmart trader monitor \u2013 Top smart money inflow. Source: SpotOnChain\n\nIn the meantime, the top 2 smart money outflows were Injective (INJ) and Wrapped BTC (WBTC). Smart traders dumped $12.05 million and $6.66 million worth of INJ and WBTC, respectively.\n\nSmart trader monitor \u2013 Top smart money outflow. Source: SpotOnChain\n\nWhat do WBTC and Bitcoin ETFs have in common?\n\nEssentially, WBTC is a synthetic version of Bitcoin (BTC), running on Ethereum and other DeFi blockchains, similar to Bitcoin ETFs. Someone does the custody of the real Bitcoin, while the traders get exposure to its price activity on other markets.\n\nArbitrage might occur if any connected assets have a huge price variation. In particular, arbitrage smart money profits from the price difference of a base asset in different markets. These dynamics guarantee a price balance and that each connected asset can serve as a leading indicator to the other.\n\nTherefore, if there is a considerable outflow of WBTC, a similar sell-off is expected for Bitcoin or its ETFs. As one usually influences the other, it is tough to distinguish between cause and effect \u2014 a \u201cchicken-egg\u201d paradox.\n\nBitcoin price analysis amid smart money outflow\n\nInterestingly, a sell-the-news event occurred after a quick pump to $48,965 per BTC following the Bitcoin spot ETF approval. The leading cryptocurrency lost 12.4% of its value from this peak to its current price of $42,550\n\nBTC hourly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nSimultaneously, Bloomberg\u2019s ETF analyst James Seyffart reported a $484 million outflow from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Thus, in a similar flow direction to the one from smart money DeFi traders.\n\nIn this context, it is evident that ETFs might have a more extensive influence on Bitcoin\u2019s price and vice-versa. Now, the narrative is shifting towards an awaited Ethereum spot ETF approval, possibly motivating the first-mentioned smart money inflows to ETH.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Sat 13 Jan 2024 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nCurrently, all eyes are on the potential approval by the SEC of a Bitcoin Spot ETF. If this materializes, the emergence of an Ethereum Spot ETF should capture the interest of the crypto community. A prospect that would be beneficial for the ecosystem surrounding the 2nd largest crypto in the market.\n\nTowards a Revival of Investor Enthusiasm for Ethereum?\n\nThe famous YouTuber Crypto Rover echoed a projection involving Ethereum. According to it, the emergence of an Ethereum Spot ETF will be the next significant event in the crypto industry.\n\nCrypto Rover predicts a shift of market fervor from bitcoin (BTC) toward Ethereum\u2019s Ether (ETH). He believes this movement will occur after the much-anticipated approval of a Bitcoin Spot ETF by the SEC.\n\nThis prospect could change the current dynamics of the Ethereum ecosystem, which is presently facing a lack of attention from the crypto community. He attributes this situation to the recent price surge of Solana\u2019s SOL, which increased by 360% in 90 days.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum has seen a more modest increase of 48% over the same period. However, some traders believe that the situation will soon change, driven by a significant influx of capital in anticipation of an Ethereum ETF following a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nAt the Dawn of a Pivotal Stage?\n\nFor crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, the prospects for ETH are somewhat certain. According to him, the asset is in a critical situation that could result in a substantial increase in its valuation.\n\nAccording to the expert, this outlook would trigger a liquidation candle on the ETH/BTC trading chart. This concretely indicates a strong price fluctuation followed by investor funds flowing toward Ethereum.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum\u2019s Ether (ETH) is valued at $2,300. The crypto has seen an increase of 3.19% over the last 24 hours. This rise is supported by a notable improvement in transaction volume of 36.14%, reaching $12.48 billion.\n\nJames Seyffart, an ETF specialist, notes interesting developments for Ethereum. Specifically, the SEC\u2019s approval of Ethereum futures and the CFTC\u2019s designation of ETH as a commodity. For him, these are signs that an Ethereum Spot ETF could emerge this year.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Cryptocurrency markets are always in a state of flux, and Ethereum (ETH), one of the top cryptocurrencies, is under the spotlight. Recent revelations by a trader have brought attention to a major weakness in Ethereum, while a leading analyst predicts a substantial 141% rise in Ethereum\u2019s value. Additionally, we\u2019ll explore the latest updates on Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ), a rising star in the crypto space.\n\nUnveiling the Weakness in Ethereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum, known for its smart contract capabilities and versatility, has faced scrutiny as a trader highlights a significant weakness. The weakness centres around Ethereum\u2019s design, prompting the development of Layer 2 solutions to address scalability issues and enhance overall performance.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently shared an updated roadmap for Ethereum in 2023. The roadmap includes crucial priorities such as implementing the Proof-of-Stake consensus, achieving 100,000 transactions per second, introducing liquid pooling, and simplifying the block verification process. However, no specific timeline was committed to these changes.\n\nOne notable addition to the roadmap is the concept of Single Slot Finality (SSF). SSF aims to finalize blocks of transactions in a single slot, ensuring their immutability. This proposed change involves all validators in endorsing slots and seeks to make Ethereum blockchain changes irreversible without burning at least 33% of the total staked Ether. SSF is considered a key step in addressing Ethereum\u2019s design weaknesses.\n\nBold Prediction: 141% Rise in Ethereum (ETH) Value\n\nWhile Ethereum grapples with its challenges, a leading trader, Pentoshi, has made a bold prediction. Pentoshi foresees Ethereum\u2019s value surging to $3,400, marking an impressive 141% increase from its current value. Pentoshi\u2019s predictions carry weight in the crypto community due to their historical accuracy, particularly in anticipating Bitcoin\u2019s surge when it was trading between $25,000 and $28,000.\n\nThe anticipation of Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) contributes to this optimistic outlook. Major players like Ark Invest and 21Shares have submitted ETF applications for Ethereum, pending approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). If approved, Ethereum ETFs could usher in institutional capital, potentially triggering a substantial price rally.\n\nRebel Satoshi ($RBLZ): A Rising Star in the Crypto Space\n\nAmidst Ethereum\u2019s developments, Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) emerges as a promising player in the crypto space. The Rebel Satoshi presale has garnered significant attention, having sold over 100 million RBLZ tokens and raised $2 million. As the presale inches closer to the $2 million mark, Rebel Satoshi positions itself as a compelling crypto investment.\n\nBuilt on the Ethereum network, Rebel Satoshi leverages one of the most secured blockchains in the crypto space. The project\u2019s smart contracts have undergone scrutiny by a top auditing firm, Source Hat, ensuring their safety and reliability. This is one of the reasons why it is regarded as the best memecoin.\n\nInvestment Opportunity: Why Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ)?\n\nRebel Satoshi presents a unique investment opportunity for crypto enthusiasts. The presale success, coupled with robust fundraising, signifies growing interest in the project. As the presale progresses towards the $2 million milestone, investors are urged to consider Rebel Satoshi as a strategic investment choice.\n\nWith a foundation on the Ethereum network, Rebel Satoshi aligns itself with a secure and established blockchain. The audit of the smart contracts by Source Hat further reinforces the project\u2019s commitment to transparency and safety. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, Rebel Satoshi stands out as an investment worthy of consideration.\n\nNavigating the Dynamic Crypto Landscape\n\nIn the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, each development brings both challenges and opportunities. Ethereum\u2019s journey to address its weaknesses, coupled with bold predictions and the rise of projects like Rebel Satoshi, underscores the need for investors to stay informed. For those wondering how to get into cryptocurrency or which crypto to buy today for long-term gains, Rebel Satoshi offers a compelling proposition.\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Bitcoin Holders may diversify their ETF gains to Ethereum (ETH) and Retik Finance (RETIK) - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Following the approval of all Spot Bitcoin ETFs yesterday, BTC is set to skyrocket past $100,000 in 2024. As a result, investors will soon be looking for new opportunities to reinvest their ETF gains. Ethereum and Retik Finance present viable diversification choices. The cryptocurrency industry is a dynamic terrain brimming with opportunity. Diversification might be a wise decision offering potentially higher rewards.\n\nBitcoin (BTC): The Impact of Recent ETF Approval and Expected Institutional Adoption\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved over a dozen Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This is a big deal for Bitcoin and its investors. An ETF is a type of investment that tracks the price of an asset, such as gold or stocks. A spot Bitcoin ETF means investors can buy and sell shares of an ETF that holds actual Bitcoin. This way, they can gain exposure to Bitcoin without buying it directly.The approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF might benefit the Bitcoin market. It may entice more institutional investors, such as banks, hedge funds, and pension funds, to invest in Bitcoin. In the financial markets, institutional investors have a lot of money and power. They can increase Bitcoin\u2019s demand and price, as well as its adoption and acceptability.As adoption grows, so will the price. Bitcoin investors can diversify their gains by investing in other cryptocurrencies. Here are two strong choices.\n\nEthereum (ETH): The Rising Star with Potential ETF on the Horizon\n\nEthereum is a prominent cryptocurrency that is used to power a variety of dapps. ETH has attracted the attention of investors and authorities. The idea of an Ethereum ETF is one of the reasons. An ETF is a mutual fund that tracks the price of a particular asset, such as a stock or cryptocurrency. An Ethereum ETF would facilitate the purchase and sale of Ethereum on regulated exchanges. This might raise Ethereum\u2019s demand and value.Another factor is Ethereum\u2019s recent price surge. Ethereum has set new highs in recent days, hitting more than $2,600 per token. This demonstrates Ethereum\u2019s tremendous momentum and devoted community. A third reason is Ethereum\u2019s ongoing efforts to improve scalability. Scalability is the ability of a system to handle more users and transactions. Ethereum is working on a major upgrade called Ethereum 2.0, which aims to make the network faster, cheaper, and more secure. Ethereum 2.0 will use a new method of verifying transactions, called proof-of-stake.\n\n>>>> Click Here To Buy RETIK Tokens <<<<\n\nRetik Finance (RETIK): A New Player with Promising Features\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) is booming, and Retik Finance stands out in this fast-growing landscape.

According to a recent ETH price prediction, Ethereum (ETH) could surge over $2,800 by the end of January.\n\nContrary to this optimistic Ethereum prediction, ETH bears point out that Ethereum could soon run out of steam due to the rising selling pressure.

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nThe crypto market is still quite unpredictable, and there has been a large volatility in the prices of cryptocurrencies including standout performers like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. However, Ethereum has remained solid throughout the last week and has now reached the $2,400 price zone.\n\nMeanwhile, amid the controversy over Solana's Bonk token's recent price increase, Meme Moguls is claiming to address fundamental flaws inherent in the use of meme coins, ultimately seeking to rank among the top crypto coins.\n\nEthereum Crosses $2,400 Price Mark; Can It Make It to $2,500 Soon?\n\nThe last time Ethereum (ETH) traded above the $2,500 price zone was in May 2022, but that may change as the ETH price prepares to return to that level. Although it hasn't been a smooth rally since crossing the $2,000 price mark in November 2023 after hovering below the level for more than a year. Regardless, Ethereum has managed to maintain a positive price line, crossing the $2,400 price mark and now seeking to cross the $2,500 price mark after almost two years.\n\nEthereum price is currently trading around $2,434, reflecting a significant price gain of over 87% in the past year, 14% in the last month, and nearly 12% in the last 7 days. This huge increase strongly suggests that the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is mostly positive and has significant potential for both long and short-term investment, ranking it tightly among the top crypto coins to invest in.\n\nBonk Builds Momentum Despite Sharp Downturn From All-Time High\n\nBonk (BONK) faced a lot of criticism after it fell sharply by nearly 100 from its all-time high of $0.00003419. While criticism is unavoidable in the crypto realm, many attributed Bonk's outstanding performance to hype rather than actual utility. This is understandable given that the Solana-based meme coin currently has little to no utility value.\n\nRegardless of the controversial claims, the Bonk coin has been gaining ground and is now just over 50% of the way to its previously established ATH. Bonk's price which is currently hovering around $0.000014 shows a 15% gain in the last month and a 22% increase in the last seven days. If anything, the rising price of Bonk suggests a bright future for the Dogecoin-inspired project.\n\nMeme Moguls Set to Outperform Bonk and Other Meme Coins Upon Launch\n\nUnlike Bonk, and the majority of meme coins in circulation, Meme Moguls aims to introduce actual utility in the space. Essentially, Meme Moguls will function as a meme-backed marketplace where traders can buy and sell meme tokens, as well as engage in different fun and monetized activities within its ecosystem.\n\nNotably, there are two main interactive sections within the Meme moguls ecosystem - a game section where members can engage in activities such as virtual or simulated trade, and a metaverse experience dubbed Moguls World. The latter aims to foster connections among members, while allowing them to mine tokens, participate in liquidity pools, as well as engage in token staking.\n\nAt the core of its operation is the $MGLS token which serves two primary purposes - first, as an in-game currency and secondly as a governance token. This dual functionality not only enhances the utility of the Meme Moguls native asset but also positions it to potentially secure a prominent rank among top crypto coins to consider this year.\n\nCurrently, in stage 4 of its ongoing token presale, the MGLS token is priced at $0.0027, marking a nearly 180% increase from its initial launch price of $0.001. Interestingly, this upward trajectory is attributed to the adoption of a dynamic pricing model, where the token's price progressively increases with each stage of the presale until the project's official launch.\n\nThis unique approach not only provides an easy point of entry for traders but also positions MGLS tokens among the best new cryptos to invest in.\n\nFor more information about the Meme Moguls (MGLS) presale follow the link below:\n\nWebsite: https://mememoguls.com/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/meme_moguls\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

Hence, VC Spectra (SPCT) users can delve into numerous tokens and extend their portfolios across various sectors of the broader niche market.\n\nIn addition, VC Spectra (SPCT) holders can take advantage of the platform\u2019s outstanding AI trading systems to obtain advanced expertise and detect the most promising fresh Web3 projects.

Furthermore, Ethereum Classic\u2019s (ETC) popularity as an open-source platform for smart contract execution has inspired several market analysts to give a positive Ethereum Classic price prediction.\n\nMore precisely, Ethereum Classic (ETC) bulls believe that ETC could increase over $50 by the end of 2024. For reference, ETC traded at around $25 during the second week of January, meaning that ETC investors could expect over 100% gains.\n\nDespite this optimistic Ethereum Classic prediction, ETC bears warn that the token\u2019s inability to provide users with valuable short-term rewards could lead to a prolonged bearish trend. As for the latest pessimistic Ethereum Classic price prediction, ETC could trade around the $15 range by the end of the year.\n\nAVAX Price Prediction: Could Avalanche Surge Over $60 in 2024?\n\nCrypto enthusiasts praise Avalanche (AVAX) as a good crypto to buy in 2024 due to Avalanche\u2019s rising popularity among dApp developers and the platform\u2019s scalable infrastructure. In addition, Avalanche (AVAX) boasts a cutting-edge Proof-of-Stake mechanism that allows AVAX users to earn excellent staking rewards.\n\nThus, AVAX bulls are convinced that Avalanche is set to continue its positive momentum and surpass the $60 threshold by the end of 2024. For reference, Avalanche (AVAX) traded at around $35 during the second week of January, which means that AVAX holders can expect a substantial 71.42% ROI.\n\nContrary to this positive AVAX price prediction, Avalanche bears claim that holders can expect significant drops over the next AVAX price movements due to the token\u2019s highly increased volatility. As for the latest negative AVAX price prediction, Avalanche could trade at around $25 by the end of the year.\n\nExperts point to VC Spectra (SPCT) as a more viable long-term investment than Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Avalanche (AVAX), so head to the presale right away to claim a momentous bonus on any deposit!\n\nTo learn more about VC Spectra (SPCT), visit:\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nIn the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies dominated by Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Ethereum (ETH), a compelling newcomer has emerged \u2013 Pushd. As the established players chart their courses, let\u2019s delve into what sets Pushd apart, offering a simple yet promising avenue for crypto enthusiasts.\n\nRipple (XRP): Navigating Legal Waves\n\nRipple (XRP) finds itself in legal waters with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The recent request for financial statements adds a layer of uncertainty. The SEC argues that XRP gets its security label only when sold to institutional investors. With a trial set for April 2024, Ripple faces an uncertain future.\n\nDespite the legal drama, Ripple (XRP), currently priced at $0.60, retains its place in the crypto landscape. The SEC's involvement has injected volatility, but investors are patiently awaiting the trial outcome to gauge XRP's resilience.\n\nSolana (SOL): Riding the Positive Wave\n\nSolana (SOL), positioned as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency, is riding high on recent gains. A 4.5% surge brings SOL closer to the notable $100 mark. Insights from analyst Ali Martinez hint at a potential 47% rally if SOL breaks free from a bullish flag pattern.\n\nQ4 2023 showcased Solana's prowess, with a 423% quarter-on-quarter increase in market capitalization. Surpassing tokens like ADA, USDC, and XRP, SOL's decentralized finance (DeFi) Total Value Locked (TVL) reached $1.5 billion, securing its position in the crypto market.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Whales in Action\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, witnesses strategic moves by whales. Addresses like \"0xAA15\" and \"0x9314\" accumulate significant amounts, propelling ETH to an 11.42% surge in the past 24 hours. A 65.99% surge in large transactions signals a shifting landscape for Ethereum.\n\nThe recent approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF has fueled positive sentiment, with Ethereum eyeing the coveted $2,700 benchmark. Analysts foresee potential approval for a spot Ethereum ETF, further bolstering retail sentiment. Ethereum's ongoing rally showcases its resilience and potential for sustained growth.\n\nPushd (PUSHD): Simplifying E-Commerce\n\nPushd is a disruptor in online marketplaces that goes beyond simplifying transactions. As the pioneer of the Web3 platform with a fully decentralized marketplace, Pushdtransforms the e-commerce landscape. Pushd stands as a beacon of transparency in a thriving global e-commerce sector projected to exceed $6 trillion.\n\nBeyond just lower fees and immediate fund releases, Pushd introduces a suite of user-friendly features.

Together, these features position Pushd as a preferred decentralized online marketplace, ready to usher in a new era of online retail.\n\nAs Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Ethereum (ETH) navigate their paths, Pushd stands out with a comprehensive and innovative approach. In a crypto landscape often filled with complexities, Pushd's vision for the future of online marketplaces is clear. With predictions of a 50x - 100x price increase during the 2024 bull market, Pushdpresents a unique opportunity for investors seeking more than just simplicity \u2013 a transformative future for online retail.

        "title": "Three Bullish Tokens Investors Should Consider in Q1 of 2024: Everlodge (ELDG), Cardano (ADA) and Ethereum ... - CryptoDaily",
        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nCardano (ADA) recent developments have alerted the attention of analysts with the token predicted for a bullish run. Moreover, Ethereum Classic (ETC) is expected to leverage the power of the main Ethereum network for an upswing. However, Everlodge (ELDG) is making huge progress in the crypto market with the revolutionary idea of fractional ownership of real estate properties. Let's explore the three tokens and see why they have been picked as the best cryptos to invest in Q1 of 2024.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) Enables Real Estate Investment With Minimal Capital\n\nAlongside Cardano and Ethereum Classic, Everlodge is another token that is expected to rally in the first quarter of 2024. When launched, Everlodge will enable investment into luxury properties for only $100.\n\nThe platform will achieve this feat through fractional ownership of real estate properties that have been minted into digital NFTs. The implication is that instead of purchasing a million dollars worth of luxurious homes and villas, investors can purchase tamper-proof NFT assets with underlying real estate properties that are stored as an on-chain day on the blockchain.\n\nThe platform utility token, ELDG, is an erc20 token built on the Ethereum Blockchain. The token will be used for payment and transaction purposes across different Evelodge features. The project is currently in the 9th stage of presale and selling for $0.029 per ELDG, with the price increasing soon. By holding this token, investors can attract tons of rewards, such as low trading fees, maintenance fee reductions, and staking of assets for passive income.\n\nAccording to Everlodge's white paper, the team token will be locked for two years and the liquidity pool for eight years, giving more price stability for the token. The project's smart contract has been audited by an independent auditing firm and the KYC has also been completed. With a predicted price increase of 280% before the end of presale and a 30x increase by launch, Everlodge is one of the best defi tokens analysts are bullish on.\n\nCardano (ADA) Holders Optimistic Despite Recent Market Downturn\n\nNotwithstanding the recent crypto market downturn, there is growing optimism among investors that Cardano's price will turn bullish soon. This growing optimism has been attributed to the recent improvement being done on the Cardano network.\n\nIn the last 30 days, Cardano developers have made an average of 449 daily commits on GitHub to become one of the networks with the highest engagement on GitHub. Although there has been some reduction in Cardano's key market metrics, such as the reduction of 9.30% in its stablecoinmarket cap, Cardano is expected to outgrow these negativities and spark a resurgence. The token still remains one of the best cryptos to invest in the year.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) Price Predictions\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) is not having the best of moments with the token battling the bear market. The ETC token has slipped by 14.84% in the last 30 days. A look at the Ethereum Classic technical indicators also indicates that the bearish market is having a 58% advantage with the Fear and Greed Index displaying a score of 71 (Greed).\n\nHowever, Ethereum Classic can not be ruled out just yet as it leverages the power of the Ethereum network. With the Ethereum network set for a massive bull run soon, the Ethereum Classic price is predicted to rise to $30 before the end of the first quarter of 2024.\n\nVisit Everlodge\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Crypto Updates: Cardano holders Decline for 7 months Straight, Retik Finance Presale crosses $7 Million mark with ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic and ever-evolving space, with developments and updates happening regularly. In this article, we\u2019ll explore three significant updates in the crypto world, including the ongoing decline in Cardano holders, Retik Finance\u2019s successful presale crossing the $7 million mark, and Ethereum\u2019s upcoming Dencun upgrade, set to reduce gas fees and bring about transformative changes.\n\nCardano Holders Decline for 7 Consecutive Months\n\nCardano (ADA) has been a prominent name in the blockchain space, known for its robust developer engagement and commitment to creating a secure and scalable blockchain platform. Despite its strong development community, recent data reveals a concerning trend\u2014Cardano holders have been on the decline for seven consecutive months. One of the distinguishing features of Cardano is its active GitHub development activity. It consistently records the highest number of GitHub commits among blockchain platforms, indicating a high level of developer engagement and commitment to improving the network\u2019s infrastructure. However, there seems to be a disparity between the vibrant development landscape and the performance of Cardano\u2019s decentralised finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Recent statistics show that Cardano\u2019s DeFi sector is experiencing subdued engagement. This is reflected in a 21.58% decline in trading volume within the network and a 9.15% downturn in stablecoin transfers. While Cardano maintains a total value locked (TVL) of $356.54 million in its DeFi space, the dominance is primarily held by Indigo with a 23.94% share. The decline in Cardano holders can be attributed to several factors, including the overall bearish sentiment in the crypto market, the absence of significant DeFi projects on the platform, and the need for broader adoption and use cases. Despite these challenges, Cardano continues to work on improving its ecosystem, and upcoming developments and partnerships may bring about positive changes in the future. As the crypto market remains highly dynamic, Cardano\u2019s ability to adapt and grow its DeFi space will be crucial in reversing the trend of declining holders.\n\nRetik Finance Presale Surpasses $7 Million Mark with Ease\n\nRetik Finance, a blockchain project with a clear mission and vision, has achieved a remarkable milestone by surpassing the $7 million mark in its presale. This achievement is a testament to the project\u2019s utility and the growing interest it has garnered within the crypto community. Retik Finance is not just another cryptocurrency; it represents an ecosystem designed to redefine decentralised finance (DeFi) and bridge the gap between the crypto and traditional financial worlds. The project\u2019s mission is to empower individuals and businesses worldwide by providing innovative solutions that make cryptocurrency more accessible and practical in everyday life.\n\nKey features and utilities of Retik Finance include:\n\nDeFi Debit Cards : Retik Finance introduces DeFi Debit Cards, allowing users to spend their cryptocurrencies seamlessly, similar to traditional fiat currencies.\n\nSmart Crypto Payment Gateway : The platform offers a smart crypto payment gateway, enhancing transaction speed and security for cryptocurrency users.\n\nAI-Powered Peer-to-Peer Lending : Retik Finance utilises artificial intelligence to facilitate peer-to-peer lending, optimising lending rates and creating a user-friendly lending experience.\n\nMulti-Chain Non-Custodial DeFi Wallet : Security is a top priority, and Retik Finance\u2019s non-custodial DeFi wallet ensures users have full control over their assets while enjoying the benefits of decentralised finance.\n\nReal-Life Integration : Retik Finance aims to make cryptocurrency a part of everyday life, enabling practical use cases and real-world integration.\n\nThe success of Retik Finance\u2019s presale indicates a strong demand for innovative DeFi solutions that simplify cryptocurrency usage and make it more accessible to a broader audience. As the project continues to develop and expand its ecosystem, it has the potential to play a significant role in shaping the future of decentralised finance.\n\n>>>> Click Here To Buy RETIK Tokens <<<<\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dencun Upgrade to Reduce Gas Fees Considerably\n\nEthereum, the leading blockchain platform for decentralised applications and smart contracts, is on the verge of a major upgrade known as Dencun. This upgrade is expected to bring substantial changes to the Ethereum network, with a primary focus on reducing transaction costs, enhancing scalability, and enabling new use cases. Dencun will introduce a series of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) designed to enhance the network\u2019s efficiency and user experience. Some of the notable EIPs included in the Dencun upgrade are:\n\nEIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding or The Surge):\n\nThis proposal introduces temporary \u201cdata blobs\u201d that can be used by Layer 2 solutions to post transaction and proof data instead of CALLDATA. These data blobs are not stored permanently on the blockchain, resulting in significantly lower gas costs for Layer 2 transactions. The implementation of EIP-4844 is expected to reduce the cost of Layer 2 transactions by a substantial margin, making Ethereum more cost-effective for users.\n\nOther EIPs:\n\nIn addition to EIP-4844, the Dencun upgrade will include several other Ethereum Improvement Proposals, such as EIP-6780, EIP-1153, and EIP-6475, each addressing specific aspects of network optimization and user experience. The Dencun upgrade represents a significant step forward for Ethereum, as it aims to make the platform more scalable, efficient, and affordable for users and developers alike. Lowering gas fees is a crucial goal, as high gas costs have been a point of concern for Ethereum users, particularly during periods of network congestion. As Ethereum continues to evolve and adapt to meet the growing demands of the decentralised ecosystem, the Dencun upgrade is poised to play a pivotal role in enhancing the platform\u2019s competitiveness and usability in the blockchain space.\n\nIn conclusion, the cryptocurrency market is characterised by constant change and innovation. While Cardano faces the challenge of declining holders, it remains committed to improving its DeFi ecosystem. Retik Finance\u2019s successful presale highlights the demand for user-friendly DeFi solutions, and Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade promises a more cost-effective and efficient network. As these developments unfold, they contribute to the ongoing evolution of the crypto landscape, shaping the future of blockchain technology and decentralised finance.\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Retik Finance Presale\n\nVisit the links below for more information about Retik Finance (RETIK):\n\nWebsite: https://retik.com\n\nWhitepaper: https://retik.com/retik-whitepaper.pdf\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/retikfinance\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "In the cryptocurrency space, recent news has shaken the market, with Ethereum and Pandoshi emerging as protagonists of a particularly dynamic week.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) approval of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) requests has triggered a series of events leading to both a rise in Ethereum\u2019s price and a significant increase in the presale of Pandoshi.\n\nEthereum Aims for Breakout with Increased Trading Volume\n\nIn the context of a still highly volatile market, Ethereum (ETH) has shown remarkable resilience, nearing the level of $2,640 at the time of writing. This recent positive performance by ETH has manifested through two consecutive bullish daily closes, suggesting the possibility of a third if the current momentum can be maintained, and we believe it can.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Ethereum\u2019s price is still confined within a range between $2,250 and $2,750, but the recent bounce from the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe suggests the potential breakout of this band.\n\nSpot trading volume for Ethereum has increased by 35% in the last 24 hours, with investors looking to participate before a possible breakout. This increase in volume coincides with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reaching \u201cExtreme Greed\u201d territory, indicating an atmosphere of growing optimism.\n\nThanks to all the factors at play, Ethereum could be well-positioned to return to its annual highs of December in the coming days. The news of the Bitcoin ETFs approval has contributed to fueling investor enthusiasm, paving the way for new opportunities in the cryptocurrency sector.\n\nPandoshi Phase 3 Is Quickly Selling Out\n\nPandoshi\u2019s recent presale has been exceptionally successful, securing over $1.7 million within a mere two weeks since its inception. This impressive milestone underscores the growing investor interest and the project\u2019s potential within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nCurrently, Pandoshi is advancing through its third presale phase, with preparations underway for the next stage, which will see an increase in the token price, signifying a key development for both the project and its backers.\n\nContrary to initial impressions, Pandoshi is much more than a meme coin. It is, in reality, a fully independent and decentralized platform. The project\u2019s whitepaper showcases a high level of professionalism and expertise, with a strong commitment to decentralization, financial privacy, and community-led decision-making.\n\nPandoshi stands out with its multifaceted ecosystem, emphasizing decentralization, financial privacy, and community-driven governance.

Ethereum\u2019s native digital currency, Ether (ETH), fuels the network and serves as the foundation for a wide range of decentralised applications (DApps). At its core, Ethereum enables the execution of smart contracts, self-executing agreements with coded terms that run without the need for intermediaries. Ethereum\u2019s journey began with a white paper outlining its ambitious vision for a decentralised, censorship-resistant global computer. The project raised funds through a public crowd sale in 2014, leading to its official launch in 2015. Since then, Ethereum has undergone several updates, with the most recent being the London Hard Fork.\n\nKey Features of Ethereum:\n\nSmart Contracts: Ethereum\u2019s introduction of smart contracts revolutionised the blockchain industry. These self-executing contracts enable a wide array of decentralised applications and use cases. Decentralised Applications (DApps): Ethereum\u2019s blockchain serves as the foundation for a multitude of DApps, ranging from DeFi platforms to NFT marketplaces. ERC-20 Tokens: Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 standard allows developers to create tokens on the platform, giving rise to a vast ecosystem of tokens and projects. Decentralised Autonomous Organizations (DAOs): Ethereum facilitates the creation of DAOs, organisations governed by code rather than individuals, fostering trustless decision-making.\n\n>>>> Click Here To Buy RETIK Tokens <<<<\n\nSolana: A Rising Star\n\nSolana, on the other hand, is a relative newcomer to the crypto scene, but it has rapidly gained attention for its innovative approach to blockchain technology. Launched by the Solana Foundation in March 2020, Solana aims to provide scalable and cost-effective solutions for decentralised finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nKey Features of Solana:\n\nProof of History (PoH): Solana employs a unique consensus mechanism called Proof of History, granting each node its independent clock and decision-making capability. This enhances the overall efficiency of the network. Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT): Solana utilises BFT algorithms to ensure the stability and functionality of the system, even in the face of node failures. Speed and Cost-Efficiency: Solana\u2019s blockchain offers lightning-fast transaction speeds, with an average cost of just $0.00025. This scalability addresses common issues of high fees and slow confirmation times in the crypto space.\n\nSolana (SOL) vs. Ethereum (ETH): Investment Perspective\n\nAs the crypto market continues to evolve, investors are faced with the choice of whether to invest in established giants like Ethereum or explore newer projects like Solana. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the investment perspective for both. Ethereum has solidified its position as a cornerstone of the blockchain industry. With a rich ecosystem of DApps, DeFi platforms, and NFT marketplaces, Ethereum offers a diverse range of use cases. Recent updates, such as the London Hard Fork, have increased efficiency and scalability. Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), remains an attractive investment option for those seeking long-term growth and passive income through staking. On the other hand, Solana has garnered attention for its speed and cost-efficiency, making it an appealing choice for traders and DeFi enthusiasts. Its ability to process a high volume of transactions within seconds has positioned it as a strong contender in the DeFi space. Institutional and retail interest in Solana has surged, reflecting confidence in its potential for further growth. Analysts suggest that including a percentage of established tokens like Ethereum in a portfolio can offer passive income potential over the long term. However, the rapidly evolving crypto landscape also presents opportunities in newer projects like Solana. Investors should conduct thorough research to make informed decisions based on their risk tolerance and investment goals.\n\n>>>> Click Here To Buy RETIK Tokens <<<<\n\nRetik Finance: The Emerging DeFi King\n\nWhile Ethereum and Solana vie for market dominance, there\u2019s another player in the DeFi arena worth considering\u2014Retik Finance (RETIK). This innovative project, currently in its presale stage, aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance and cryptocurrencies.

        "content": "Celsius, a well-known cryptocurrency lending platform, has recently transferred $125 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) to major exchanges. This move follows the company\u2019s declaration of bankruptcy last week, highlighting a significant shift in its strategy towards liquidating assets. With concerns rising among investors about the potential impact on the Ethereum market, this development marks a critical juncture in the ongoing saga of Celsius\u2019s financial troubles.\n\nCelsius\u2019s Ethereum transactions\n\nAccording to Arkham, a cryptocurrency analytics firm, Celsius has moved a substantial amount of Ethereum to prominent exchanges, including Coinbase and FalconX. In the past week, the company has deposited $95.5 million in Ethereum to Coinbase and transferred an additional $29.73 million to FalconX. This activity indicates a strategic shift by Celsius as it navigates its bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nDespite these sizeable transactions, Celsius still retains significant cryptocurrency assets. Its wallets currently hold over 539,000 ETH, valued at approximately $1.4 billion, along with 9,800 BTC (worth about $419.2 million) and various other altcoins, including MATIC. This substantial portfolio suggests that the company\u2019s recent actions are part of a larger strategy to manage its assets amid financial restructuring.\n\nImpact on Ethereum and broader cryptocurrency market\n\nCelsius\u2019s decision to transfer such a large amount of Ethereum has raised questions about its potential impact on the cryptocurrency market. This is especially pertinent as Ethereum has been experiencing robust growth, with investors optimistic about the future of the asset. The anticipation around Ethereum spot ETFs, with several applications submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), adds to the market\u2019s sensitivity to such large-scale movements of assets.\n\nLarry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has been vocal about the potential value an Ethereum spot ETF could bring to the market. BlackRock is among the entities that have applied to the SEC to launch an Ethereum spot ETF. Decisions on these applications are expected between May and August of this year, adding a layer of complexity to the current market dynamics.\n\nCelsius\u2019s strategy and future outlook\n\nThis recent transaction is not the first instance of Celsius liquidating a significant portion of its Ethereum holdings. In December 2023, the company reportedly sold $243 million worth of ETH, alongside other altcoins. However, the latest move comes at a time when the company has ceased Ethereum staking, which it had previously valued at around $800 million. As stated by Celsius, this decision is geared towards preparing for asset liquidation and repaying debts to its clients.\n\nThe company\u2019s strategy in dealing with its current financial challenges is being closely monitored by investors and market analysts. The impact of its actions on the Ethereum market, in particular, is of significant interest, considering the platform\u2019s considerable holdings in the cryptocurrency."

        "content": "In the cryptocurrency space, Ethereum and Pandoshi emerge as the dynamic duo for long-term success. These two tokens not only provide a diversified portfolio but also embody a dedication to innovation, inclusivity, and the transformative potential of decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum, often hailed as the pioneer of smart contracts, has played a pivotal role in the cryptocurrency sphere since its inception. By introducing programmable contracts, Ethereum pioneered decentralized applications (DApps) and laid the groundwork for the expansive DeFi ecosystem. Its robust and adaptable blockchain has become the preferred choice for developers, enterprises, and individuals seeking a secure and decentralized environment.\n\nWith the imminent Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, focused on enhancing scalability and energy efficiency, Ethereum is positioned to maintain its prominent position in the cryptocurrency industry. Investors seeking long-term stability, innovation, and a proven track record in the blockchain realm frequently include Ethereum as a fundamental element of their cryptocurrency portfolios.\n\nPandoshi (PAMBO)\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrencies, new coins often present promising opportunities. It\u2019s worth noting that more than 94% of these freshly introduced cryptocurrencies, launched on various platforms, experience substantial price surges, often exceeding 300%, on their very first day. Impressively, about 30% of them even witness remarkable leaps, occasionally surpassing a staggering 4000% gain on the same day.\n\nWhat makes these new cryptocurrencies appealing to investors is their immense potential for rapid growth. These coins are in their early stages, far from reaching their full potential, and with a limited supply, they tend to experience significant price fluctuations, especially in their initial phases. After thorough evaluation of numerous new projects, Pandoshi has emerged as a standout contender.\n\nPandoshi\u2019s ecosystem comprises various components, including an environmentally friendly Layer-2 Network based on the Proof of Stake protocol, offering a greener alternative to traditional Proof of Work systems. The platform also incorporates a decentralized exchange, the secure non-custodial Pandoshi Wallet, engaging metaverse activities, educational initiatives, and cryptocurrency-compatible prepaid cards.\n\nAt the core of this ecosystem lies PAMBO, the primary utility token crucial for transactions within PandaChain, the Metaverse Game, and Pandoshi University. Its value is further augmented by the buy-and-burn strategy implemented by PandoshiSwap and Cardoshi.\n\nPAMBO, being a deflationary token, will cease its buy-and-burn policy after eliminating 80% of the total tokens from the market. Due to its deflationary nature, acquiring PAMBO is possible solely through direct purchase or active participation in official Pandoshi activities.\n\nOut of the 2 billion PAMBO tokens created, half are allocated for the presale, while the remainder serves various purposes: 20% to boost liquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEX), 10% for centralized exchanges (CEX), and 20% for the Bonus program.\n\nPandoshi\u2019s strategic roadmap outlines a clear approach and tactics for achieving its goals, projecting significant advancements and milestones, making it an appealing choice for potential investors.\n\nAs market analysts delve into PAMBO\u2019s potential, they are starting to establish bullish price projections. Considering the strategic tokenomics in play, Pandoshi presents a convincing argument for a favorable price trajectory. Given the prevailing market sentiment and the growth strategies embedded in its ecosystem, experts anticipate that PAMBO could reach $0.10 within weeks of trading. Such a milestone would signify a substantial 1000% return on investment from its initial valuation of $0.01 per token, reflecting the high level of confidence in Pandoshi\u2019s future prospects.\n\nPandoshi stands as an attractive option for individuals seeking an affordable cryptocurrency with the potential for substantial gains. It represents a digital currency poised for growth, supported by a strong community and a well-defined forward-looking strategic plan. PAMBO coins can be acquired directly from the project\u2019s official website.\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Pandoshi Presale\n\nVisit the links below for more information about Pandoshi (PAMBO):\n\nWebsite: https://pandoshi.com/\n\nWhitepaper: https://docs.pandoshi.com/\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

        "title": "SEC unlikely to approve Ethereum ETF in near future, say TD Cowen and JP Morgan - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "In a recent report by TD Cowen, a prominent American multinational investment bank, it has been projected that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will unlikely approve an Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) anytime soon.\n\nThe bank\u2019s Washington Research Group suggests that the SEC will prioritize gaining experience with Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs) before considering the approval of Ethereum or other crypto token ETPs.\n\nThis assessment aligns with JP Morgan\u2019s cautious outlook, which also believes that Ethereum ETF approval hinges on its classification as a commodity rather than a security. This change might not occur in the immediate future.\n\nDelay expected in Ethereum ETF approval\n\nThe TD Cowen Washington Research Group anticipates a significant delay before the SEC approves an Ethereum ETF. The bank\u2019s report highlights the need for the SEC to familiarize itself with Bitcoin ETPs before venturing into Ethereum or other crypto tokens.\n\nAccording to their analysis, it could take up to 26 months before the SEC is prepared to approve an Ethereum ETF. Furthermore, they suggest that any such approval will likely be postponed until after the upcoming elections in the United States.\n\nTD Cowen\u2019s report emphasizes the importance of the SEC\u2019s experience with Bitcoin ETPs as a prerequisite for considering Ethereum and other crypto token ETPs. This cautious approach stems from the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, marking a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nThese approved ETFs include Blackrock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, and Bitwise Bitcoin ETF. The SEC decided to approve these Bitcoin-focused ETFs after years of delay and multiple rejections.\n\nJP Morgan shares a similar Outlook\n\nTD Cowen is not the only financial institution expressing skepticism about the swift approval of an Ethereum ETF. JP Morgan, another leading player in the financial industry, shares a similar viewpoint. According to Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a Managing Director at JP Morgan, for the SEC to consider approving spot Ethereum ETFs, Ethereum would need to be classified as a commodity, akin to Bitcoin, rather than a security. However, he doesn\u2019t foresee such a reclassification happening in the near future.\n\nThe delay in approving an Ethereum ETF has significant implications for the cryptocurrency market. While Bitcoin has been the focus of the SEC\u2019s regulatory efforts and is now gaining recognition through ETFs, Ethereum remains uncertain as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The absence of an Ethereum ETF limits investors\u2019 access to this digital asset through traditional financial channels, potentially affecting its adoption and growth.\n\nInvestor Caution and Uncertainty\n\nInvestors in cryptocurrency are urged to exercise caution and remain patient regarding the SEC\u2019s stance on Ethereum ETFs. The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies continues to evolve, and the approval process for new financial products may take time. Investors must stay informed about the latest developments and regulatory updates to make informed decisions regarding cryptocurrency investments."

        "content": "JPMorgan expressed skepticism about the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) likelihood of approving spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by May, marking the first deadline for such approvals. According to Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a representative from JPMorgan, the SEC\u2019s classification of ETH as a commodity, similar to Bitcoin, is crucial for approving spot Ethereum ETFs. Panigirtzoglou stated:\n\nFor the SEC to approve spot Ethereum ETFs in May, it would need to classify Ethereum as a commodity (similar to Bitcoin) rather than a security. This is far from given, and I wouldn\u2019t put more than a 50% chance to the SEC classifying Ethereum as a commodity before May.\n\nThe SEC recently approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, a significant development after over a decade of rejections. Traders are optimistic that spot Ethereum ETFs could be the next in line for approval. However, Panigirtzoglou emphasized that the SEC is still signaling its stance, indicating that it views all cryptocurrencies outside Bitcoin as securities. Last year, JPMorgan suggested that U.S. lawmakers might create a new category for ETH to avoid classifying it as a security.\n\nWill Ethereum Follow Bitcoin\u2019s Footsteps?\n\nMeanwhile, ETH\u2019s price experienced a notable surge between January 10 and January 12, gaining 13.5%. This boost saw the cryptocurrency break above $2,650 for the first time since May 2022. The catalyst for this rally appears to be the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nSource: CoinMarketcap\n\nInvestors question whether cryptocurrency can maintain its current market capitalization of $322 billion. Over the past 60 days, ETH\u2019s price has outpaced Bitcoin\u2019s positive move, gaining 27% compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 24%.\n\nThe approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs was expected to increase Bitcoin\u2019s price by opening up new opportunities for clients who could not directly acquire cryptocurrency. However, ETH\u2019s recent surge has led to speculation about its potential to steal Bitcoin\u2019s thunder in the market.\n\nBloomberg ETF analysts currently estimate a 70% chance of an Ethereum ETF approval by May, in contrast to a 95% likelihood for Bitcoin. Major asset managers, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and VanEck, are anticipating the final SEC decision on spot Ethereum ETFs by May 23. Some analysts, considering the precedent set by Bitcoin, believe the final decision might come sooner than anticipated.\n\nRelated Reading | FTX Customers Demand Fair Compensation For Crypto Losses"

        "title": "EIP-4844: Understanding the New Scalability Solution of Ethereum - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "For crypto protocols, the biggest challenge today is scalability. That\u2019s probably the biggest reason for why it is lagging behind fiat money. For many years, blockchain protocols have tried to solve this issue. They have come up with many solutions, some showing strong potential.\n\nEIP-4844 is one of those solutions introduced by Ethereum. It decreases the gas fee and boosts the efficiency of the whole protocol. The proposal is also known as \u201cProto-\n\nDanksharding\u201d, something that works based on sharding. For the uninitiated, sharding is fragmenting the blocks into various smaller portions.\n\nThis way, it makes the network faster and more efficient. However, there\u2019s much more to EIP-4844 that cryptos users need to understand. So let\u2019s dig into this concept and see what more there is to learn about.\n\nEIP-4844: Ethereum\u2019s Answer to Scalability Issues\n\nTo understand that, it is important to be familiar with the concept of sharding. It divides the blockchain into several small parts to make the transactions faster. These small parts are called shards that operate independently. They pave the way for the parallel processing of transactions with a set of validators and states.\n\nThey always function as a team to amp up the efficacy of the whole blockchain. On the other hand, Unsharding is the reversal of the block-breaking process. It unifies the blocks of the Ethereum network.\n\nThe Mechanism of EIP-4844\n\nEIP-4844 brings forth the concept of Proto-Danksharding. Instead of doing a simple sharding, it creates something called \u201cblobs\u201d. The blobs represent the smallest data units attached to Ethereum\u2019s blocks. They also come with specific storage for layer-2 rollups.\n\nAccording to Ethereum, this new mechanism reduces the transaction time to a significant extent. With that, the fee is reduced and the platform becomes more accessible for development. The Proto-Danksharding adopts a more efficient ecosystem that works on L2 rollups.\n\nAs per the Ethereum team, Optimistic and ZK (zero-knowledge) rollups are quite instrumental for its scaling strategy. They both reduce the fee by 3 to 8 times lower than Ethereum\u2019s base layer. However, the reduced fee doesn\u2019t solve all the problems that existing users face in the ecosystem.\n\nApparently, they need solutions that could deliver efficiency while bringing the cost down. Moreover, EIP-4844 seems to be more of a stopgap solution. It would not work unless the full data sharding is implemented to the hilt. The blob transactions are facilitated by consensus nodes and are included in the beacon chain.\n\nThe very structure of the blob transactions confines the data size to 0.375 MB/block. It\u2019s temporary but manages the network load and cost very well.\n\nTechnical Insights Into EIP-4844\n\nWith EIP-4844, an all-new gas pricing mechanism enters the ETH ecosystem. It automatically adjusts the network\u2019s blob gas and balances the usage depending on the traffic. These many functionalities play a pivotal advancement in Ethereum\u2019s scalability.\n\nIn addition to this, the Proto-Danksharding handles fixed-size data chunks very effectively. Blobs decrease the block sizes and isolate them into a sidecar. Furthermore, the data layer works as a separate entity. Additionally, this new structure prunes the data effectively while enhancing efficacy and lowering cost.\n\nAbove all, EIP-4844 creates a merge-free market, unlike traditional systems. It works with a single proposer for all transactions and simplifies the network\u2019s complexity. Without incorporating overburdening validators, this protocol manages the unified system of transactions. While inducting Proposer/Builder Separation (PBS), it also brings actors with dedicated functions.\n\nFor example, block builders choose the slot\u2019s contents and the proposer chooses the highest-bid valid header. Also, it distinguishes gas from blobs, while maintaining limits and prices well. This separation verifies the content efficiently through data availability. On top of that, it promotes separate fee markets for data and execution.\n\nProto-Danksharding is an advanced concept that is inherent to EIP-4844. It implements frameworks, logic, verification rules, and transaction formats. The validators involved in the process validate the full data without spending plenty of time on evaluation.\n\nAdvantages of Using EIP-4844\n\nTransaction fee reduction for cost-effective usage of all Ethereum-based tokens.\n\nScalability in global transactions and better management of so many applications.\n\nEnhanced Competitiveness that makes the network a viable option for businesses.\n\nStreamlined Data to make long-term storage easy and more sustainable.\n\nFuture-proofing for new and additional network upgrades on Ethereum.\n\nImproved UI for delivering a better experience to users trying to adapt DeFi services.\n\nUpshot\n\nEIP-4844 requires improvement and is temporary in nature. Still, it addresses many issues and expedites transactions while making them cheaper. For many obvious reasons, it is a significant upgrade to the Ethereum network. It boosts scalability and brings forth many other possibilities. Hopefully, it will get more viable in the future in order to ensure a broader adoption."

        "title": "Anticipation Grows: Will Ethereum (ETH) Spot ETF Get the SEC Nod in 2024? - The Currency Analytics",
        "content": "In a significant move for the cryptocurrency market, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently gave the green light to a spot Bitcoin ETF, albeit with a touch of hesitation. With this breakthrough, attention within the crypto community is now shifting toward Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, as speculations arise regarding the SEC\u2019s stance on an exchange-traded fund tracking its performance.\n\nThe year 2023 witnessed a surge in ETF-related news, particularly with various companies filing applications for both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) products. The momentum gained momentum, especially after BlackRock entered the arena mid-year, inspiring other entities to follow suit.\n\nWhile nearly a dozen BTC ETFs are now actively trading on US stock markets, the spotlight has shifted to Ethereum. Notable companies, including Grayscale, are vying to launch ETH ETFs, with attempts to convert their existing ETH Trust into a spot ETF, mirroring their success with the flagship GBTC Trust.\n\nDespite the growing interest, the SEC has consistently delayed decisions on these applications, pushing most of them to wait until May. Historically, the Commission has been known to either delay or reject crypto ETFs for years before granting approval. The lingering question now is whether this pattern will hold true in the case of Ethereum.\n\nTo gauge community sentiment, analytics platform Santiment conducted a poll, revealing that over 52% of respondents believe the US will witness a spot Ethereum ETF by the end of the year. A further 10% are even more optimistic, predicting approval as early as this month, while 11.3% are skeptical, asserting that it may never materialize.\n\nPrice Effects and Market Dynamics\n\nA historical analysis of similar developments in the cryptocurrency market, such as the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, offers insights into potential price effects. BTC experienced a surge in the months leading up to SEC approvals, with a notable spike on the first day of trading. However, this upward trend reversed swiftly, resulting in a significant slump of almost $8,000 within 36 hours post-approval.\n\nThis trend, commonly referred to as \u201csell-the-news,\u201d has given astute investors an advantage. Interestingly, Ethereum\u2019s price has only recently begun to climb, possibly indicating a speculative run as market participants anticipate the approval of an ETH ETF.\n\nThe Road Ahead for Ethereum ETF Approval\n\nWhile the SEC\u2019s recent approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF has generated optimism within the crypto community, the path to Ethereum ETF approval remains uncertain. The Commission\u2019s historical tendency to delay or reject crypto ETFs raises questions about the timeline for Ethereum\u2019s inclusion in the market.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s efforts to convert its ETH Trust into a spot ETF, following the success of the GBTC Trust, underscore the industry\u2019s eagerness for diverse investment opportunities. The involvement of major players like BlackRock further intensifies the anticipation for a broader range of crypto investment products.\n\nCommunity Insights and Expectations\n\nAs the Santiment poll indicates, a significant portion of the community is optimistic about the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF in 2024. The sentiment reflects a growing appetite for diverse crypto investment options and the belief that regulatory barriers are gradually lifting.\n\nConclusion: Navigating Uncertainty\n\nIn conclusion, the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF has set the stage for increased optimism and speculation within the crypto market. While Ethereum enthusiasts eagerly await a similar nod from the SEC, the historical context of regulatory decisions prompts caution. The journey toward a diversified crypto investment landscape continues, with Ethereum at the center of attention."

        "title": "Altcoin Mania: Ethereum Leads, But Optimism (OP) and Pullix (PLX) Ready to Outshine the Market! - Blockchain Reporter",
        "content": "Crypto enthusiasts and investors are hyped about 2024 being a very bullish year. With this bull market starting soon, Ethereum (ETH) has already claimed a front position, rallying when Bitcoin slides.\n\nHowever, there are two top altcoins that are set to outperform the market in 2024 \u2013 Optimism (OP) and Pullix (PLX). Read on to find out why these altcoins are set to outperform the market.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Leads the Bull Market, Crosses $2,400\n\nEthereum (ETH) has picked up after the recent drop in the $2,100 support level. The price of Ethereum is up by more than 12% on the weekly chart as it rallies past $2,400. The ETH rally has been accompanied by several positive reports.\n\nAccording to WuBlockchain, more than 78% of all Ethereum addresses are now in profit. In addition, there has been an acquisition spree as whales expect the price of Ethereum to continue increasing. LookOnChain reported that Justin Sun is at the heart of the acquisition.\n\nSun has purchased more than $143 million worth of Ethereum since January 1, as per LookOnChain. Other whales have joined the acquisitions as they expect altcoins to rally in 2024. While Ethereum has been on the upside, it is being outperformed by some top crypto coins, including Optimism.\n\nOptimism (OP) Soars As Binance Supports Network Upgrade\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest centralized crypto exchange, Binance, has announced that it will support the upcoming Optimism (OP) upgrade. In anticipation of this upgrade that has promised to bring increased efficiency to the Optimism crypto, the OP coin has been rallying.\n\nThe Optimism crypto has snapped its week-long downtrend, rallying by 14% to reach $3.70. This price puts OP in a good position to extend its gains. If the Optimism price reclaims the $4 resistance level, then it could rise as high as $5, making it one of the top altcoins to buy.\n\nPullix (PLX) To Lead the Altcoin Market in 2024\n\nPullx (PLX) is one of the newest platforms generating much buzz in the crypto space. PLX has been increasing, reaching $0.08 in the last week. However, analysts have predicted that this new DeFi coin could outperform the altcoin market in 2024. So, why are analysts bullish about this new coin?\n\nEveryone is talking about Pullix a lot because they see it as a potential first look at the future of cryptocurrency exchanges. Pullix is a type of hybrid exchange that contrasts conventional ones. It implies that consumers can benefit from the advantages of both DEXs and CEXs. Because of this, Pullix is made to provide users with a trading experience that is more seamless, affordable, and secure than that of any other exchange.\n\nPullix has branched out into international financial markets in an effort to give its customers as many options as possible. It currently offers trading in FX, ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds), and commodities as a result. With over $6.6 trillion in daily trade volume on the forex market, PLX is a worthwhile cryptocurrency to purchase.\n\nPullix and PLX have a lot of space to expand because these markets offer even more liquidity than cryptocurrency exchanges. Analysts project that in 2024, Pullix\u2019s price could rise by up to 100x due to this potential. PLX is one of the best DeFi coins to purchase as a result.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile Ethereum is currently leading the altcoin rally, Optimism (OP) and Pullix (PLX) are the two top crypto coins you should watch out for. The upgrade brings significant improvement to Optimism and provides OP with room for growth. Meanwhile, Pullix has tapped markets bigger than crypto, giving it the potential for a parabolic price rise in 2024.\n\nFor more information regarding Pullix\u2019s presale see links below:\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities"

Data from on-chain analytics platform Santiment has revealed Ethereum and other large market cap cryptos are now at extremely optimistic levels.\n\nEthereum Shines As Investor Optimism Persists After Bitcoin ETF\n\nBitcoin is enjoying its time in the spotlight, with a lot of discussions centered around the cryptocurrency and the performance of 11 spot ETFs in their first two days on the market. According to a social media post by Santiment, Bitcoin sentiment and discussion rate are now at their highest level since March 2023.\n\nNotably, other major cryptocurrencies have been quietly gaining ground. One of the biggest winners is Ethereum, which has seen its price grow post-Bitcoin Spot ETF approval. Traders have particularly been bullish towards Ethereum, with the crypto currently leading the market in terms of sentiment. Ethereum\u2019s sentiment and discussion rate is now at its highest level since November 2021 as traders are discussing the possibility of the approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs coming next.\n\nDiscussion around spot ETF approval has also flowed into XRP, with its sentiment and discussion rate now at its highest level since May 2023.

        "content": "Ethereum, often referred to as the king of smart contract platforms, is on the cusp of a transformative upgrade known as Dencun.\n\nIn the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, two significant developments have captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. Ethereum (ETH), the pioneer of smart contract platforms, is gearing up for the highly-anticipated Dencun upgrade set to enhance its scalability and efficiency. Meanwhile, Retik Finance (RETIK), a rising star in the DeFi space, has made headlines by swiftly surpassing $7 million in its presale. In this article, we will delve into these exciting updates and their implications for the crypto market.\n\nEthereum's Dencun Upgrade: A Leap Forward in Scalability\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEthereum, often referred to as the king of smart contract platforms, is on the cusp of a transformative upgrade known as Dencun. This upgrade also referred to as Cancun-Deneb, is slated for completion in the first quarter of 2024, and it promises to usher in a new era for the Ethereum blockchain. The primary focus of the Dencun upgrade is to address some of the pressing challenges that Ethereum faces, namely scalability, efficiency, and security. These improvements are set to be achieved through a series of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). One of the notable EIPs that will be implemented as part of the Dencun upgrade is EIP-4844, also known as proto-danksharding. This proposal is expected to bring tangible benefits to Ethereum end-users, particularly in the form of reduced gas fees for layer-two (L2) transactions. Lower gas fees are a welcome development for the Ethereum community, as they enhance the cost-effectiveness of using the network. The Dencun upgrade follows the successful Shanghai upgrade, which enabled staked ETH withdrawals in April 2023. With nine EIPs slated for implementation, the Dencun upgrade marks the beginning of \"The Surge\" era in Ethereum's development roadmap. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has expressed the network's ambitious goals during The Surge, emphasising the removal of scalability bottlenecks. The ultimate aim is to achieve a staggering \"10,000 transactions per second and beyond.\" This monumental scaling effort will pave the way for Ethereum to handle mass-scale adoption effectively. Key among the EIPs within the Dencun upgrade is proto-danksharding, which is poised to play a pivotal role in enabling Ethereum's transition to layer-two rollups. The reduction in gas fees for Ethereum L2s is expected to drive an ecosystem-wide shift towards rollups, further enhancing Ethereum's scalability.\n\nClick Here To Buy RETIK Tokens\n\nRetik Finance (RETIK): Surpassing $7 Million in Presale\n\nWhile Ethereum's Dencun upgrade is poised to elevate the network to new heights, Retik Finance (RETIK) has been making waves in the decentralised finance (DeFi) space. The project's remarkable performance in its presale has caught the attention of investors and underscores its potential as a game-changer. Retik Finance is on a mission to reshape the world of finance by offering a range of innovative DeFi solutions. These include DeFi debit cards, a next-gen payment gateway, AI-powered peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, and one of the most secure DeFi wallets available. The project's commitment to bridging the gap between cryptocurrencies and everyday life has resonated with investors seeking real-world applications for digital assets. The presale stage of Retik Finance has seen overwhelming interest and support from the crypto community. Investors have rushed to secure their stake in this promising project, and as a result, Retik Finance has surpassed $7 million in its presale, a significant milestone that was achieved earlier than expected. This impressive achievement in the presale highlights the enthusiasm and confidence that investors have in Retik Finance's core features and real-life application. As the project prepares to conclude its presale phase, it is poised for further growth and development in the rapidly evolving DeFi landscape.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum's upcoming Dencun upgrade promises to address key challenges and enhance the network's scalability and efficiency. This upgrade aligns with Ethereum's ambitious goal of achieving mass-scale adoption through layer-two rollups and reduced gas fees. Simultaneously, Retik Finance (RETIK) has emerged as a formidable player in the DeFi sector, with its groundbreaking DeFi solutions capturing the imagination of investors. Surpassing $7 million in its presale is a testament to the project's potential and the growing demand for DeFi platforms that bridge the gap between cryptocurrencies and real-world applications. As Ethereum and Retik Finance continue to make strides in their respective journeys, the crypto market remains as vibrant and exciting as ever, with innovation and adoption at the forefront of these developments. Investors and enthusiasts are eagerly awaiting the positive impact these two projects will have on the crypto landscape in the coming months.\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Retik Finance Presale\n\nVisit the links below for more information about Retik Finance (RETIK):\n\nWebsite: https://retik.com\n\nWhitepaper: https://retik.com/retik-whitepaper.pdf\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/retikfinance\n\n\u201cCrypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "content": "When Vitalik Buterin, the brain behind Ethereum, talks, the crypto world listens.

Buterin\u2019s candid reflection is a reminder that even the most advanced blockchains are a work in progress.\n\n>>BUY $ROE TOKENS NOW<<\n\nFilecoin: A New Force in Decentralized Storage\n\nMoving from Ethereum\u2019s challenges, let\u2019s talk about Filecoin.

        "title": "Crypto Market Price Analysis Today: BTC, ETH, BONK, LINK, SOL - Blockchain Reporter",
        "content": "Last week, there was strong anticipation that Bitcoin\u2019s value would surpass $48,000 and settle close to $50,000 by the weekend. However, defying these forecasts, Bitcoin underwent a notable downturn, sliding towards $41,000, even following the SEC\u2019s approval of a spot BTC ETF. In spite of this downturn, Bitcoin has seen some rebound, presently hovering around the $43,000 mark. Current analysis indicates that a further decrease might happen, with $38,000 being a pivotal level for a possible strong recovery.\n\nDespite lacking a strong upward market trend, the Bitcoin ETFs still attracted significant attention from traders. Records indicate that the total trading volume for these newly introduced Bitcoin ETFs surged above $5 billion. Following this initial adjustment, it\u2019s anticipated that Bitcoin will stabilize within a certain range in the short term, as traders anticipate the start of institutional investments into these ETFs.\n\nOver the longer term, the combination of Bitcoin ETFs and the upcoming Bitcoin halving in April 2024 is expected to lead to a reduction in supply, potentially driving prices upwards.\n\nWhich support levels could potentially trigger buying interest in Bitcoin and altcoins? We\u2019ll examine the chart patterns of today\u2019s top 5 cryptocurrencies to discover this.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis\n\nBitcoin price has been fluctuating a lot recently, as bears continue to defend the EMA200 trend line aggressively. However, buyers remain active near the dips. This indicates buying activity at lower price points and selling during price rises. As of writing, BTC price trades at $42,896, declining over 0.3% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nThe price continues to face rejections above $43,500, suggesting that the market is not sustaining higher levels. The RSI level below the midline at level 36 suggests a rising bearish dominance among traders.\n\nBears will soon attempt to send the price toward $40K to test buyers\u2019 patience. However, this level might trigger accumulation and should there be a rebound, the bulls might send the price above the EMA20 trend line at $44,000.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Analysis\n\nThough ETH price rejected the overhead resistance at $2,700, it currently holds buying confidence above $2,500. Interestingly, there was a robust accumulation near the dip of $2,450. Currently, Ethereum price trades at $2,548, surging over 0.2% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nThe initial resistance is set at the ascending line near $2,700, a level which may prompt short-term traders to take profits. However, if ETH maintains its position close to this level, it will imply that traders are buying on every small dip. This behavior could enhance the likelihood of Ether reaching the key psychological mark of $3,000.\n\nOn the downside, the first notable support is at $2,400. Should this level be breached, the price could potentially decline to $2,200.\n\nBONK Price Analysis\n\nBuyers are defending the Bonk price above moving averages on the 4-hour chart. However, the descending resistance line creates a hurdle for the meme coin. As of writing, Bonk price trades at $0.0000148, surging over 10% in a single day.\n\nBears are working hard to drag BONK/USDT below the 20-day EMA; however, there\u2019s a solid accumulation near the dips. The leveling EMA lines and the RSI hovering just above the midpoint offer no distinct advantage to either bulls or bears.\n\nIf BONK breaks above the resistance line, we might see a quick surge toward the $0.000023. However, to defend this surge, bears need to pull the price toward $0.00001.\n\nChainlink (LINK) Price Analysis\n\nChainlink price has been pumping hard in the last few hours as it gained solid buying pressure with a jump in 24-hour trading volume toward $495 million. As of writing, LINK price trades at $15.2, surging over 8.1% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nThe 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $14.5 is beginning to rise, suggesting a bullish advantage. However, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) heading toward its overbought region, there\u2019s a small edge for the sellers as a correction is around the corner. However, a break above the resistance line at $16 might strengthen buying pressure.\n\nSolana (SOL) Price Analysis\n\nSolana\u2019s price has been fluctuating within the confines of an uptrend and a downtrend line for several days now. The nearly flat 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $96, combined with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovering around the midpoint, fails to provide an edge to either buyers or sellers.\n\nIf the price remains below the 20-day EMA, there\u2019s a potential for the SOL/USDT pair to drop towards the $89 level. Should this support level break, the decline could extend to the support at $80.3.\n\nConversely, if the bulls successfully push and maintain the price above the moving averages, they could gain control. This could lead to a breakout above the resistance channel at $103, sending SOL price above $120."
